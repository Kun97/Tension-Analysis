They were also very protective parents, they protected us enormously and spoiled us. Sometimes, the other young children, teenagers were baffled to see how overprotected we were, but later, when I grew up, I understood that my parents didn’t want their children to experience what they themselves have lived through.

He came to our home and he stayed with us; he was killed during the genocide. That’s it, that’s all I can say. My parents were hard-working people, discreet, very discreet, and proud, very proud too. I remember, people in our region were saying that we were rich. [laughter] They believed—they thought—they would say, “Oh, they are rich!” while other families were in a situation similar to ours.

Then, in the evening—paff!—they said that the President had just crashed, his plane had just crashed. Just a few hours prior to that, I wouldn’t have believed there could be an accident because the soldiers from the UN mission were there and we had signed peace treaties in Arusha. In my mind it was rather—well, I—in my mind I thought it was—I thought that something good would come out of it, that we would make it through. But when I heard the news—I was with friends of mine, a family—when we learned that apparently the President’s plane was burning, a dark picture emerged right away. To me, it was clear. It was like I could see what was going to happen. And at that moment I was ready, I was ready. I thought that if Habyarimana were killed, it was over. I had been thinking, “Even if he had died from a sickness, we are going to pay.” And this time I thought, “If he’s been killed, it’s over.” There was no doubt in my mind. If I could have left, I would have right away—leave the country, that is—I would have, but I couldn’t. We heard that roadblocks had been set up and we could hear gunshots all night—they had already started killing people. This family and I, we fled to Saint Paul [Centre], near Sainte-Famille, and we stayed there for three months. We arrived on the 7th in the afternoon and we left a few days before they captured Kigali, we were evacuated to Kabuga, in the zone controlled by the RPF.

I was seeing people getting back to their lives, regaining the desire to live, but I was—I felt guilty about that too. I said to myself, “Why am I not like the others? Why am I not happy?” I wasn’t happy to have survived, I felt guilty. I thought, “I’m not normal, I’m not—” [is thinking about the word]—that I’m not grateful.

I thought I would call myself Gakwerere, because in Rwanda we don’t carry the family name. And I talked about this to my friends, they were laughing, but for me it was serious. The first thing I was going to do was—well, on the identity cards that we were given, I was going to adopt the surname… And then one day in Kigali, I was with a friend, and I met this person, the same one I met in Kabuga, who wanted to give me something, who wanted to give me money, and he said to me, “Josée, do you know that your father is alive?” [makes a facial expression of shock] [laughter]",Interviewee,No Tension

He ate for the first time—well, not the first time, but it had been so long that he had forgotten what food tasted like. And it was like he was brought back to life. Then we started talking, telling each other everything that had happened, the horrors he had lived through. He had spent three months in Bisesero, in the bush [inaudible].

They—people were saying, “Hey, you, the fugitives, go quickly, go either to the church or to Bisesero in the high mountains, but don’t come home.” So that’s how they left. And my mother was preparing to leave too. There was a girl who was living—a cousin who was there with my mom and also another girl who was living with us—oh, that girl survived, she was the one who told me the story afterwards. My mother gave her the keys to the house—my mother always had a bundle of keys, and she said, “Take the key, if anyone survives, you will be able to open the door to the house for them.” And, apparently, while she was saying that, she was also praying the Rosary, the girl told me. Then they attacked the house and my mother, my cousin, and this girl, they ran out, in the other—in the opposite direction. But the killers ran after them. And there was a man on the hill on the opposite side who told the killers, “That’s where they are, go through there, go through there!”",Interviewee,Tension

What they didn’t take was the cement that covered the floor, that’s the only thing they couldn’t take. So that’s it, they took it all. They thought that even the old pot was worth something or that an old basket had some value. Apparently, they took everything. There was a jerrycan filled with gas because we didn’t have electricity in the village, we used candles to light the rooms in the house, and my mother was buying large quantities of gas. They came across that and they were convinced that the gas was to be used to burn Hutus. Then they waited for my father, they went to look for him and for my two brothers. And my father, after hiding the cows, wanted to go back, but people said, “Don’t go home, they’re waiting, they’re waiting for you. Your wife, the children who were there—finished, your house—forget about it.” So my father remained in Bisesero, on the hills of Bisesero. So that’s the story I was told.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Oh yes. There are things, events we didn’t talk about, but that were, like, in—in—not in continuity, but in—that were in keeping with—which pointed to the same direction. As I told you, when I was 7–8 years old and we were made to stand up and were told “abanari hano, abahutu hano,” that was—it’s not normal to talk to children like that. And it’s not normal to indicate one’s ethnicity in—why was the ethnicity written on the identity cards? Or in a child’s personal file at school, from the age of 6, 1st grade? That indication was something that followed you throughout your life. So that’s not normal—that’s what I say is not normal. They knew what they were doing. I didn’t experience the events during the years of the Revolution, my parents lived through that, but we lived in the continuation of what had been started. For example, the information in these personal files followed you until you got your identity card where it was clearly stated that you were Hutu or Tutsi or Twa, but it also prevented us from continuing our studies. That was—that’s the real genocide. Preventing someone from studying is like killing that person, they are already dead. I think that was also part of the genocide; the genocide wasn’t only the outcome, it was [a process that was] already there, it had already begun. It was a very frustrating thing to do, preventing children from studying when they have the abilities; preventing people from having access to services, to jobs, preventing people from working is—it was—I think it was a continuation of what had started before. In fact, it had never stopped. Some people won’t believe it if you tell them that it had never stopped, but I know it, I feel it—it had always been this way. We were scrutinized: whether you had access to high school, what you were going to learn in high school, which section you were enrolled in in high school—everything was monitored. Going to university was almost unthinkable. There was—you had to do a whole lot of maneuvering to be able to access university studies. It was difficult, it wasn’t easy at all, everything was observed, it was—things were doled out to us until—they were aware, I think they knew that at some point they would finish what they had started.

But afterwards I could at least say: “I can walk down the street, I can walk with my head held high, I’m not ashamed of who I am.” I told myself, “I’m more or less safe.” But at the same time the old demons—",Interviewee,Tension

I had registered, we put together the file, we filed it with the Ministry of Education and then—there was no response. At one point my father went to the Ministry, I think he wanted to check something in his teacher’s record, and someone there told him—one man spoke to him in a way that was very hurtful to my father; the man said, “It seems that you want to send your daughter to study in Canada?” My father started to—he didn’t know what to say, so he said, “Yes…, no…” And the man said, “But who do you think you are?” My father understood what that meant and when he came back home he said, “Forget it.”",Interviewee,Tension

The social network I built after the genocide was like—in fact, it was like another life had began. It was like making your first steps: we learn to talk, to walk, to reflect, to think. So I missed very much the people with whom I had started this second life because we had a kind of a symbiotic relationship. We had everything in common.

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"[laughter] And he’s someone very generous, very intelligent too, very bright, he understands everything. He understands everything, you don’t need to explain much, to say anything, he understands. He might even be able to read a person’s state of mind. With him, I’m not worried about risking being misunderstood during difficult moments or when I revisit the darkest periods of my life or my past—he is able to understand everything and to refrain from judgement, to let me live through this as I want to, as I can, he lets me be. Yes.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,What is your view on the children’s upbringing? [laughter] You have a boy and a girl?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, a boy and a girl. It’s not always easy [laughter] because I have my African and Rwandan traditions and on the side of their father there is the North American, Quebec, Western education, so it’s not always easy. But at the same time this enriches the children, and we’re already seeing the results. Yes, yes, they are not—they are balanced, intelligent children, who are appreciated—my whole life is greatly appreciated—who know how to live together with others. So, combining the two [cultures] creates something good. At the same time their environment at school, it’s Québécois, it’s not Rwandan—but my influence… As a father he is very present. I am proud of this meeting of two mentalities, of two cultures, which initially don’t have anything in common, but which ultimately complement each other nicely. You only need to see the children’s openness to understand the society in which we live, to understand that they won’t live in the same world in which I’ve lived. Even in Rwanda it has evolved a lot. The world in which I was raised is very different from the one in which the children are raised today. There is a greater openness, so I don’t have to impose my upbringing on my children—no, far from that. We raise our children with the future in mind; we raise them so that they can adapt to this society, adapt to being good to others, helpful, compassionate, sensitive to the problems of others. Yes, that’s it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Sometimes girls and boys are brought up differently. I don’t know if you’re seeing—in Rwanda raising a girl and raising a boy—I don’t know if it was the same in your family. If you consider how you were educated, the values, the education that were transmitted to the girls, was it the same as what was transmitted to the boys?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"No, I can’t use my family as an example, because with us it was different. At home I didn’t feel a difference, I didn’t feel that boys were favoured—on the contrary. We had to deserve what we—to expect appreciation, we had to deserve it first. I never felt inferior to the boys because I was proving myself, I was good at school, I had good grades, there was nothing that predisposed me to be inferior to the boys. On the other hand, I’ve seen—for sure, [in Rwanda] boys were more favoured than girls. So if one of the children had to leave school because the parents couldn’t afford it, it was the girl who left school to help her mother. I wasn’t in—I was lucky not to live in such conditions. My parents knew the advantages of going to school, of education, especially since my mother had had the chance to study. They knew that it was very important for girls to study and even to go farther than they have, to live in better conditions. They took it upon themselves—they worked very hard, very, very hard [inaudible] they wanted us to go farther than they had, I could see that. So they wanted me to go to university at all cost, to go to university at all cost. Yes.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,And with your own children—you have a boy and a girl—,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,I think that—,Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, it will be the same thing, we will offer them the best of ourselves, the best possible conditions, as far as possible. So yeah. I see no difference between a boy and a girl, frankly, I don’t see it, no.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"What would you do if—how—some children could be a bit difficult, others could be easier and still others could be doing things we, in the family, don’t like. And whether we like it or not…—how do you manage all that?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, for sure, we put ourselves in the child’s place—",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"—and we say, “What’s going on in his little head?” But we’re also not making up stories, we show the children what to do. We talk to them, we must listen to the children. We must listen to them and we must talk to them. It’s true, children do stupid things, adults as well. And in fact, every time a child makes a mistake, it bothers me how we can get carried away, we are ready to punish the child. But I’m thinking to myself: adults do stupid things too, knowing full well that what they’re doing is stupid, and no one is running after them to punish them. So why are we punishing the children, who are weaker? Rather, [we should] try to understand what motivates the child’s behaviour, understand that and then listen to the child. Then everything will be alright. Maybe the behaviour is due to factors in our environment or aspects of our own selves, and when we understand that, we can take measures, we can talk to the child. Well, for now they are still young, [laughter] we aren’t confronted yet with the big problems, they are still very young, we have no problems with them. Yes.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"Of course, there are many things that change for the better, I find. The country is changing a lot. I have the impression that when we leave a place, we think we will find it again as it was when we left, but that’s not what happens. Our lives are where we are, my life is here. I go back there to see family, friends, but I feel that my life is here even if every day, every day I think about Rwanda. Every day I think about Rwanda. I think about this little country that I love so much. I follow the news from Rwanda, everything that’s going on in the region, I am always up-to-date with the latest news. Rwanda is part of me, with the good and the bad memories, Rwanda is part of me. I follow all the news, I’m interested in everything. At the same time, I love this country too, this welcoming country, I like the people here, I like how open they are, I like their authenticity. Still, we check our history, our past, our education against the culture of our host country. But it’s going well, it’s going very well, we know how to distinguish between the two. Yes.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"I think about it. [laughter] Yes, I think about it. Listen, when you leave your country at the age of 30, uh, you can’t completely cut the cord. I miss it sometimes: the sun, the hills, the birds… Sometimes I miss it a lot. That doesn’t stop us from functioning well, from living where we are now… But you never know, you never know, I remain open to the idea. I am not torn, though, I don’t feel torn. At the same time, I’m not closing the window to this idea: maybe, why not? Rwanda is still our country [laughter], our little Rwanda. I love our country. Yes, it’s ours, it’s my life.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE MARIE-JOSÉE GICALI-LS-English translation.docx,"It might happen or it might not. I’m not unhappy here, I feel good here, and when I go back to Rwanda I feel good there too. [laughter] I don’t impose a limit. I know that when I go back to my country I’m welcome there, I’m welcome, I feel good there. And it’s the same when I come back here; I want to come back.",Interviewee,Tension

Yes, it’s cyclical. April is a very difficult month. That’s when I start having nightmares, I cry for nothing, I am irritable, in my thoughts, I am with the people who are dead. Yes, that’s April.

I don’t want to lie to her, but I don’t want to say everything either because at her age it’s not good, she can’t understand. So, I just leave it at that. She is beginning to ask questions about her grandparents, about my grandpa, my grandma—on her dad’s side of the family and on mine too. On my side, she at least knows my father, her grandfather, but she asks, “What was my grandmother like? How did she die?” Well, I say, she was killed. “Who killed her?” Ouf, that’s tough. So yes, I can’t wait for her to grow up, to begin to understand. You know, at my daughter’s school, they talked about wars, but at their level of understanding.

I liked watching them, they fascinated me. I have always been fascinated by elderly people because they carry historical baggage and they have so much to tell. I remember better my—let’s say that I was closer to my paternal grandfather, his name was Eustache Kajuga. He was a pastor but, most of all, he was a decent man. Our family learned a lot from him. Whenever there were tensions or small issues in the family, he would calm things down. He would say comforting words to me and would explain to us how things should be done.",Interviewee,Tension

He left me many memories of family reunions—he loved family reunions, he really liked us being together and that’s something I have inherited from him. I enjoy being with my family, I enjoy family gatherings. So, I remember this grandfather well. I also remember my maternal grandfather, he was Belgian, his name was Jules Rolland. My memories of him are more about the games we played together. He showed me many things: we would go for walks, he was pointing out to me things in nature, little things—small examples that I liked very much.",Interviewee,Tension

Like my paternal grandfather, the family gatherings were for her—she was always there, it was something important to her. She was also the one who helped my mother integrate—my mother was Belgian, and my grandmother was the one who helped her integrate into the family. It wasn’t easy for my mother when she first arrived, because she came from a different background, she was, as they say, a muzungu [white] and, well, it wasn’t easy. With time, the women’s help—it was the women who helped her integrate into the family and they opened the doors to her. I am thankful to my grandmother for that: for facilitating that, for helping my mother integrate and for considering her as one of the children in the family.",Interviewee,Tension

So, what kind of interactions could you see between your father, your mother and their parents? What are your memories of that?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"My father was very respectful of his father, of my grandfather. In a way, my grandfather was viewed as a teacher, the one we would turn to when we needed an explanation, when we had a problem. Dad always viewed Grandpa as the head of the extended family. And it wasn’t based on fear, we weren’t afraid of our grandfather—he really was very nice—their relationship was quite—it was very friendly. Their connection—their discussions—my grandfather really was—he was at the centre of the family. On my mother’s side—because of the distance between them—she had decided to live in Rwanda—it was at first a little tense, well, a lot of tension, in fact, due to a lack of understanding: why did she move so far away? why did she leave? why did she go to live in Africa? The grandparents didn’t really understand my mother’s choice. So their relations were strained, but over time—they even came to visit us in Rwanda. That helped calm down the tension a little and things were going very well after that. My mother wrote to them all the time, I remember the letters in the mail, and my grandparents wrote back, they sent small parcels, biscuits, Belgian chocolates, which didn’t last for more than two days. And those are the memories I keep: of my grandparents in Belgium, who lived far away, who sent us little messages as expressions of affection, letters, small gifts, and then in Rwanda it was the lessons learned within the family, the discussions, the sharing of ideas. What I also remember, when I think of my grandparents in Rwanda, what first comes to mind is the countryside. They lived—my grandmother still lives there, in Gahini—every time we went there, I rediscovered the cows, the lake, the walks in the forest.

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"I would now like to ask you a question about how your parents expressed emotions—emotions such as affection, joy, anger, fear—what in Kinyarwanda we call igitsure: when parents want to instill a sense of fear in their children, not to terrorize them, but to elicit respect, that’s called igitsure. How did your parents show that? I would like to ask you to tell me first about one of your parents—either your mother or your father, it’s your choice. How did they express affection, from what you remember from your childhood?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Of course, they raised me based on their own experience. No doubt about that. My mother was educated—and I think my father too—in the old-fashioned ways where the father was the authoritative figure. And they tried to raise us in the same way—myself, my brother and my sister. But I didn’t fear my mother, we were close. And I was an agitated child; like everyone else, I was doing stupid things. When I did something really stupid, my mother would hit me sometimes, as a kind of punishment. She was trying to explain to me how I should behave, she had the mind of a psychologist. She would kneel down next to me and that’s how she talked to me—she had a more flexible approach to teach me to stop doing stupid things. My mother preferred talking to hitting. With Dad it was—he was quite flexible too, but his was a more African approach. We were slapped when we did stupid things, without much discussions, without much dialogue—there was some distance, [he was] a bit removed emotionally. It was similar to how all Rwandan dads are with their children: they remain at a distance, avoid being too close, too friendly with their children. I wasn’t too upset about it since I could see that it was like that in all other families. But it was also a way of fearing him, since we didn’t know how he would react; we were trying to guess his state of mind: is he going to be mad? is he in an agreeable mood?—so there was always this doubt. And then there was the way he looked at us. His gaze expressed a lot: he liked to frown, as if to say to me: “I’m not going to say much more, you understood me.” And I understood what—the message he wanted to convey.",Interviewee,Tension

Now, well, all that was—the rest—[sigh]—I would say, those were Dad’s decisions—whether it was going on a trip, for example, or whether we had to go somewhere, it was Dad who decided when, because his schedule was—he had to look at his availabilities, because he was working a lot at the time. So it was more my Dad who was deciding to—when we would leave, where we would go. And at home, it was my mom who ran her house, her employees, she made sure that the whole house was clean. She hired the people who worked at home, she trained them, she taught them to cook, Dad never participated in this. Also, when there were difficulties in the family, it was often Mom who would pinpoint the problem and would ask Dad to do something about it. Sometimes—I’ll use the example of an uncle who was going to have his fifth child, and I remember that Mom went to see his wife, my aunt, she went to see her and she told her, “You’re going to have your fifth child, I think it should be your last one.” My mom defended women’s values, she fought for the emancipation of Rwandan women and when she saw a woman who had no say, who unwillingly had [children], many children and, well, when it looked like the husband had decided to have a child and the wife had no say in the matter—I remember that she had gone to see my aunt and tell her that she must not remain quiet and that if she didn’t want any more children, she shouldn’t have any because she isn’t a machine for babies.

She was the one who would nail the problem on the head and later she would tell Dad, “Listen, you have to address that. Can you talk to your brother and see—” And Dad was involved more in all matters outside of the house—travel, the purchase of materials. And school—in terms of homework, Dad was never involved in our homework. He didn’t know anything about what was going on at school. He was interested in the results. Our report cards had to be green; if he saw the colour red somewhere, it meant a failure and that’s when there were issues, questions: Why? We could tell him all we wanted that: “But the class average is… I’m in the average.” He would say, “No, no, that’s not how it should be. I’m seeing things written in red here and that means failure.” While my mom would go more in depth, she would try to understand [why].",Interviewee,No Tension

I was in third year of secondary school going into fourth and I wrote the second round of exams, and I was waiting for the results. And Mom—I was so afraid to look at the results at school that I asked my mom, “Can you go instead of me?”—they were posted at the school, at the Belgian school—“Can you go see for me? Because if I go and Dad—if I repeat a year, I won’t be able to come back home, Dad will—I’m finished!” So Mom went to see the results and then she called me at home. I answered the phone and she said, “Congratulations! I think you’re going into fourth year of secondary school.” I was so happy, I ran to the room where my dad was, I ran to him and I said, “Dad, I succeeded, I’m going into fourth year!” His reaction was not one of joy, he gave me a kick in the behind.

Sometimes, I went out with the bashumba [cowherders]. I walked with them and their cows—I liked the cows—and I walked along with my little stick. These are for me beautiful memories.

He was the one who showed me how to be like that, how to treat others. And my mother taught me how to be sensible, how to talk to people in a certain way, to be interested in others. She taught me empathy, to put myself in other people’s shoes, to see their problems from their perspective. My mother was such a person.

He often talked about that, he often told that story. So it’s really—that’s my grandfather from Belgium, that’s the memory I have of him when he was a child—well, not a child but more like an adolescent. He often talked about the concentration camps and how he survived, about the war—that had affected him deeply. From my Rwandan grandfather, I don’t have—well, I only heard some stories afterwards, and he wasn’t the one telling them. I know he was adopted, no one knew his father, no one knew his parents, he was adopted and he grew up in a family. I learned these thigs a little bit later. But neither him nor my grandmother told me anything about their childhoods. As for my parents, well, there were many stories on the side of my mother, because there were photographs from when she was little and she would explain: “Oh, here, we are at such and such a place in Belgium…” She kept many pictures of her childhood, adolescence, she had kept all those pictures and that’s how I learned about her growing up and about her journey.",Interviewee,No Tension

He went to school in the village and he often reminded me—he often told me that he didn’t have the chance to study, that he had succeeded thanks to his determination and that determination is always needed in life because he didn’t have the chance to study, but by his strength of resolve—to find work, to move, to move far away in order to look for work, he has always been very—he always wanted—he always was—as if he had a goal in life, a real goal, and he wanted to achieve it.",Interviewee,No Tension

My dad was the first one to help his neighbour finish his roof, buy roof tiles or metal sheets, and the first one to give him money to complete the construction of his house. My dad helped out many families with the education of their children, he paid their tuition fees. Mom played the role of counselor, a bosom friend of many women in the neighbourhood. She had a friend who lived—well, we lived in Kicukiro and there was, I remember, a very, very poor woman there. I remember her because every time I saw her coming, I would say to my mother, “She’s coming to ask you for money again, she’s coming to beg, and her son, who is an alcoholic, will drink all this money!” And my mother kept telling me, “Listen, always help those in need.” That woman was poor, she didn’t have much to eat and she came to our house, but instead of giving her money, my mom gave her food—fruits—and she said to me, “You see? I’m not giving her money, I’m giving her sustenance. It’s not the same thing.” So, really, in our neighbourhood my parents were—people knew us, they knew my parents, they knew that there was a very nice muzungu in the neighbourhood.

She was especially engaged in the cause of women. She was committed to the cause of the Rwandan woman, and she did a lot. And Dad too had made the most of—he had also succeeded. It was as if he wanted to give back to his friends who had helped him or his family. He was the leader in the family who was trying to encourage others to study, to start their own business. When people were about to get married, they would come to see him and ask him to participate in the expenses, it was—he also helped voluntarily.

So I—during my childhood, my adolescence, I didn’t know my sister very well. The only memory I had of her was her running with my brother in the garden—I was younger and they often played together. She looked after me as big sisters do, but we didn’t play together. She was a bit like a second mom to me when I was little—we didn’t play together much. I only have very few memories of Catherine from when I was a child. With my brother Sam, on the other hand, we grew up together; we played all kinds of games together. I was constantly trying to follow him, even though he didn’t want me to always be in his way. We played a lot together and we were also fighting a lot.

Every time we played, I thought to myself, “I must be better than him.” I was emulating him, I watched what he was doing. And with time, I became better at high jump—I wasn’t better at all disciplines, but I managed to surpass him in some.

He was always—I always competed with him: if he liked doing something, I had to do it too. For example, he liked the Audi car brand, so I had to get a car from another brand, Peugeot. We were constantly competing. Same thing with soccer: during the World Cup he was cheering for Germany and I was cheering for France, just to be different from him.

And there is still a feeling of distance between Catherine and I—no doubt, the distance of all the years we didn’t see each other. And also because we have different characters—I’m much closer to Sam in terms of character and in my way of being, more generally. He is still my role model: starting a family, having stability in life. Whenever I have important decisions to make, I go and talk to him, not to my sister.

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yeah, well, being at school was not an easy time for me, because from the start I wasn’t a good student. I didn’t put in the necessary effort to catch up with the others. It was as though I knew I wasn’t a good student and I thought, “Well, I’ll resign myself to do the minimum of effort.” I remember one of my teachers in particular—his name was Monsieur André, well, his name is still Monsieur André—he was my math teacher. Things were not going well between him and I in his classes. It was—I always had bad grades and he—well, he wasn’t trying to help me either. His was the class I didn’t like at all so my worst memories are from this math class at the École belge in Kigali—[laughter]—with my teacher, Monsieur André, who was very strict, and whom everyone feared, and I was the one bearing the brunt of his punishments: I had to clean the blackboard, anything that needed to be done, anything unpleasant, I was always the one to do it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Geography, history classes, drawing—I was very good at drawing—and also gym class, those were my favourite. I hated anything that had to do with science. And even—I remember one day, I brought home a marked math assignment, and I think he had given me something like two out of ten; I showed it to Mom and said, “Mom, what do you want me to do, I’m not good at math?” She said—she admitted that math was also her pet peeve, she said, “You know, math is not my strong suit either.” In fact, sometimes I showed her my [math] homework and she wasn’t able to correct it or to help me. And then my dad’s reaction, instead of trying to see if he could do anything [to help], was to say, “I’m going to get you private lessons, okay?” So there was this teacher who was coming to our house and who was trying to bring my math skills up to speed. It wasn’t easy, but I always managed to narrowly pass my math class. That’s it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"In fact, I finished high school in Belgium, because when the genocide started, I was in my fifth year of secondary school and I finished it in Belgium. I had to adapt to life in Belgium, so I lost maybe two years before finally finishing high school. After I arrived in Belgium in 1994, I spent one year without doing anything. I started school the year after that, but it was a different environment: the teachers were different, the relationship between students and teachers was different. So, let’s say I lost two years at the time when I was in high school. Then, when I started again, I became interested in marketing and I enrolled—in Belgium, students go directly to university after high school—so I enrolled to study marketing. Every year at Christmastime, I dropped out of the program. I did that two years in a row: I dropped out at Christmas.",Interviewee,No Tension

Before, my parents were the driving force pushing me forward; they were always there to push me even to the point of threatening me. Since I’m not a student at heart, someone who likes to study, it wasn’t surprising I was dropping out since I didn’t have anyone to pressure me or push me, and that’s what happened two years in a row in Belgium, and— [short break in the recording] And that’s it.

I noticed a lack of stability [in my life] after the genocide, really, a complete lack of stability.

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"At the time of the genocide—I can take as a starting point the 6th when the plane was shot down—I was in my bed, I was anticipating a normal night and going to school the next day. And then, around 6-7 o’clock in the evening, we heard the blasts. Two big explosions. We didn’t pay much attention to it, we thought it was grenades exploding in the surrounding areas. There were always the sounds of gunfire, grenades, even in our neighbourhood, which was rather quiet, we were always hearing the occasional shot and so we thought, “It must be a grenade.” So I went to sleep and in the morning—very early in the morning, around 5-6 o’clock—my mother came to wake me up and she said, “You’re not going to school today, the plane—the President is dead.” To me this was good news, I said, “Oh! I’m not going to school! That’s good!” The President is dead, well, we’re going to—the country will open up—because I was always hearing on the radio that the President was against the Arusha Accords, the President this, the President that, so I thought to myself, “Well, this is good news!” I saw that as the end of all of the country’s problems and I thought that everything was going to be all right in Rwanda. And we spent the morning—very early in the morning until—we even had breakfast around 8 o’clock. And then the shooting became much more repetitive; until then, shots were fired only occasionally, but at 8-9 o’clock the bombing started. And, well, we were beginning to—I could see my dad calling people left and right, he didn’t talk to me at all, I don’t remember my father talking to me that day or—at home that day, he was always on the phone, he was pacing back and forth. Without thinking, I went to the garden, I looked out, I saw houses being blown up, I saw grenades, [I heard] shots… Maybe I can provide a bit of context here. When I was a student at the Belgian School, I grew up in—I was like a child isolated from all the problems in Rwanda, ignorant of the ethnic groups, ignorant of Rwanda’s fundamental problems. I hadn’t paid attention to the different political movements, I thought of them as soccer teams—with their flags, their street demonstrations; to me they were like competing soccer teams. I never took them seriously. Even at school, I remember, I was classmates with the children of ministers, the children of high dignitaries. Kabuga’s children were also there, and Mbonyumutwa’s children, the children of all the military officers—almost all of them were there; I was friends with them. I remember at one point it became fashionable to wear small medals [points to his shirt] with the party symbol, and they were wearing those to school. I remember I was making fun of them, I was saying, “Your president is a dictator, he’s not letting the other parties express their voice! The MDR [Republican Democratic Movement] is no good.” I was saying that innocently, without really—just for fun. I knew that Dad was in the PL [Liberal Party] and I was proud to say it. I was saying, “Yeah, one must be a liberal!” I saw the liberals [the members of the Liberal Party] as—the very word, “liberal”—as free. We are free. So, at school, I boasted, I was always saying, “Oh, one has to be free, you are in movements, in parties led by dictators,” and things like that. There was never any aggression, never a threat on my part. And it went on like this. If a child had come up to me and had said, “Hey, you, we’re going to kill you” or if someone had attacked me, maybe then I would have seen the sign and I would have understood some of what was going on, but never, ever, was there a single complaint about—it was all for laughs… We were joking.",Interviewee,Tension

And I thought—he was older than me, he must have been 18 years old, and I would ask him, “I come home after you, and you’re always here, why is that?

I was asking too many questions: “Why are you always home? Why aren’t you going out? Aren’t you going to play basketball?” Sometimes I played basketball in our neighbourhood, and I would say, “Come with me, we’ll play.” He was always afraid to go out of the house, especially in the few months before [the genocide], especially in late 1993, early 1994, he was always at home. One day he said, “Listen, my parents live in Nyamirambo and I go to an Apacope school [Parents’ Association for the Contribution and Promotion of Education].” And I said, “Why are you living with us? Why don’t go back to your parents’ house?” He said, “Because going back to Nyamirambo is more dangerous than coming to Kicukiro.” I said, “But why?” He said, “Because we get attacked sometimes in the street.” In the Nyamirambo neighbourhood—he had to walk through there, and he said that it was dangerous, that sometimes he got stopped by the police and that even in his family home in Nyamirambo there were often—the militia would pass by, soldiers would pass by, just like that, and observe the young boys who were there; he was a tall guy and older than the others. It was only afterwards that I realized that all the young people of that age were getting arrested from time to time, they would spend the evening in prison, they were beaten up. But at the time when he was telling me this, I thought he was being stupid. I said, “No. What are you talking about? No. Come, we’re going out, we’ll play basketball.” And he didn’t want to, he didn’t. Once, I came back home from playing basketball and I was singing, I was whistling in the courtyard of our house and he said, “No! You shouldn’t whistle, you shouldn’t whistle. If they hear you, they’ll come here.” I said, “Who?” He said, “The interahamwe! If they hear someone whistling, they’ll take it as a signal to come here—[inaudible: end the—?]” I didn’t understand what he meant at all. I said, “Are you delusional? What is—? Here, at home?

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Very naive. And what really confused me in this whole story, all this drama in Rwanda, was my uncle. I had an uncle, Robert Kajuga, he was the little brother—he was the youngest son in the family, my father’s little brother. And when he was starting out, all the young people knew him very well because he had a soccer team. He was well-known, he had many girlfriends, really very well-known to the young people in the country. And he was spotted by the President’s clan and the members of the [inaudible] party and he was offered to be the head of the interahamwe in Kigali. He ended up becoming their president. When it happened, I found it extraordinary. I thought, “It’s really—the family is protected, the family is this and that…” And that’s—it was—afterwards, after everything happened, so after 1994, that’s what troubled me the most. And it’s the reason why I wanted to do this interview—on the one hand, to explain my version and get it out—it’s like a burden for me and my family. And no, it’s something that I’ve never understood and that I will never understand because he no longer exists, he is dead. But being the president of the interahamwe—it’s as though he wanted us to die… And—when he came over to our house or when we passed him on the street he was very nice. He grew up—I grew up with him, by his side, and everything was going well until he became involved in politics. After that there was tension in the family. I remember, he was about to get married and my grandfather talked with the girl’s father, and there were accusations: “Oh, he’s an interahamwe,” and this, and that… In any case, this whole story is very disturbing, how he got involved in this. My dad was meeting with his [other] brothers to talk about that. No one understood his [uncle’s] choices. What was clear was that he liked money, he loved success, visibility, and that everything was offered to him. So it’s really—he jumped on it for the profit, to make—for money and success, but I think he was naïve about it, he didn’t see the boundaries, he didn’t see what the repercussions would be, so, really, he jumped on it for the profit, to make—for money or for the—for success. But I think he was naïve about it, he didn’t see the boundaries, he didn’t see the—what the consequences would be.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"I hear a lot of people saying that his hands were tied during the genocide, that he’s saved some people but he’s killed others, so it remains—for me it will remain a mystery. And in a way, I think it’s better that he’s dead. I think it’s better because otherwise, it would have caused the destruction of the whole family. So that’s it. This is the part where I bring up my uncle, it’s also to address that confusion I lived with when I was young and that’s where—I also remember when Dad—when I asked him questions, I asked him—because I was thinking about my uncle, but also about my cousins ​​who were worried about being attacked, and I didn’t understand. One day I asked my dad, I said, “What is our ethnicity, in fact?” He laughed. My mother was right next to him, she didn’t say anything, and we just continued on with our day. Sam also asked, “Yes, what is our ethnicity? We are in the Liberal Party and they say that the people there are Tutsi. You’re saying that we have to put the small—” We had to wear the small medallion with Habyarimana’s, the President’s, picture on it. My dad would put it on when he was going to conferences. Sam said, “But sometimes you wear the small President’s medallion, so what are we, after all?” He said, “We are like everyone else, you know, we are Hutu.” And we never spoke about that again. And so I grew up thinking that. I continued on with my life, time passed. In my mind, I was Hutu. And it all made sense: my uncle was president of the interahamwe—that was confirmed and [my response] to my cousin who was worried was, “No, our family is protected, don’t worry, nothing will happen.” And so, with all these elements in place, the plane crashed in the night of April 6 and then, in the morning, my mom woke me up very early and said, “The President is dead.” And then—well, then we started hearing gunshots, and around 11–11:30 in the morning they were still announcing on the radio that we should stay inside our houses, remain calm, stay at home, stay inside. And then around noon, half past twelve—I remember, we were sitting at the table—that’s the image I have from that day, we were sitting at the table—like Jesus’ Last Supper. Dad was there, Mom, my cousin, another cousin was there too. It was as though we were going to have our last meal, everyone felt that, and I too ended up understanding that there was tension, something that I couldn’t grasp, couldn’t understand. No one spoke, no questions. We were hearing gun shots, but we were going to have a meal. I believe we ate a little bit.

What are they doing here? Why? Did they tell you why they are here and everything?” He said, “No, they want to speak to you. Come, they want to speak to you.” My grandfather said, “Well, if I talk to them, I might be able to send them away and explain that we don’t have—that there is nothing for them to do here.” He went downstairs, five minutes later he came back and said, “No, they want to come in. They say they want to search the house, to see—they had heard gun shots and are wondering if they weren’t fired from here or if—they want to search the house.” So, Mom said, “I’ll go with you.” With my grandfather. “Maybe if they see a muzungu, they’ll understand that—” So Mom went downstairs with grandpa and—the same thing. They came back up: “They say that either you go talk to them or they’re coming in.” So this game went on for about fifteen minutes and the more time passed, the more soldiers gathered at the door. They arrived with jeeps and the zamu alerted us each time: “Another jeep just arrived. They are numerous, they will break down the door.” There was even—the zamu had placed a tree trunk at the door to try to curb the—and so even our Hutu friends—they couldn’t do anything.

Anyway, when you’re in the moment, you don’t think too much, you try to follow your instinct. So we left the house and we went behind the small cistern. From there, I glanced back, I saw the front gate and the soldiers coming in, I quickly looked back and I saw a barrage of soldiers going in and the door was—we had to go through an open area [in the garden], we had to cross maybe five meters to get to the gate that would take us to the neighbours’. So I thought, “If we go through there they will see us and they will shoot us. So I say we go back.” We went back to the house, because they already had—they were circling the house. I said, let’s go back inside, maybe nothing will happen to us. We tried to run away, but I think it would have been disastrous. So we went back into the house and we waited. The soldiers arrived, they circled the house, they came inside, we were all there gathered in a group. There were ten of us and they placed guards, […] arms in the air—so, they invaded the house completely, soldiers everywhere, they asked us to go out, to go on the terrace. We obeyed.

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"One day after the attack. So we were all there, waiting. The soldiers were searching the house. One of them came out, I think he was a colonel or—I don’t remember, but he was the leader. He came out and told Dad to go inside and bring everything he had, whether it was money or—and to show him where he was hiding the weapons. He was talking to him in Kinyarwanda, of course, and in a violent way, he was pushing him: “Go, go, show me the weapons—and your money—bring out everything!” We were still gathered outside, on the terrace. I remember I took cover close to my mom, I asked her, “What’s going on? Why are they—? What are they going to do?” And she said, “Stay quiet! Stay calm. What is bound to happen will happen, but you are here with me.” Those were the last words she said to me. During that time Dad was inside, I didn’t know what was going on, where he was. I couldn’t see him, but I could hear the sounds of cupboards falling down, windows breaking—they were throwing everything on the ground, as if they were looking for something. The leader with whom Dad left came out of the house and he was discussing something with the other soldiers, he was talking to them. We couldn’t hear anything and that’s when I broke my silence. I walked towards him, I came close, but not too much, and I spoke to him, I said, “Ntambunda dufite, ntacyintu dufite, turi abantu beza, ntacyintu twakoze.” I tried to tell him that there was nothing, that we were pacifists, that we hadn’t done anything, that—and even if I didn’t understand the issue of why they were there, I understood that they were looking for something and that we were in a bad situation. The soldier standing right next to him and holding a rocket launcher turned towards me and pushed me back with it, with his rocket launcher. It took me—I really felt how hot it was and he pushed me back towards Mom and said, “Ceceka wambwa we!”—“Shut up!” So, I really—I burst into tears and took cover close to my mother who didn’t speak and just hugged me. Then the colonel, the leader who was talking with the others, he went back into the house and the soldiers told us, “Go to the garden and lie down on the ground on your stomachs, and do not say a word. We don’t want to hear a sound from you.” That’s when I thought that those were our last moments—what are we going to do? Should we run? Should we flee? Should we keep our hopes up—maybe they were only pretending? So many questions. I was wondering what—I’m sure the others were asking the same questions, except they knew why they were there, they knew very well what was going to happen while I didn’t know it yet. I said to Mom—I remember asking her, “And what about Sam? Sam and Catherine?” They were in Belgium, they had left to study there well before this took place, so they were in Belgium—I told her, “What—” I said, “Sam and Catherine?” She smiled and squeezed me in her arms. That’s when she told me these last words, “What’s bound to happen will happen, you’re here with me, everything will be all right!” We then went down to the garden, all ten of us, and lay on the ground. And I don’t know how—it was fate—I lay down in such a way that my mother was partly lying on top of me—we were lying on our stomachs—and she placed herself partly on top of me and she wrapped her arm around me as if to protect me from what could happen. So we were all lying on the ground and there was maybe—we heard the sounds of boots moving left and right, a lot of jostling, and then—there really were a lot of soldiers there, I don’t remember how many, but at least thirty for sure—and there was a hubbub that I can’t even describe, the house was so crowded—they were breaking the windows—and at one point, I heard the words—they were talking to each other—I heard, “Shoot! Shoot fast, fast!” And he said, “Aim at the heads, aim at the heads—in this way it’ll be done quickly and then we’ll go.” And then I heard shots, they were starting. They were shooting at us, one after the other. They were at a distance of two meters away, a little above us, at the level of the terrace, we were a little below and they were firing, but I didn’t see anything, because we had our heads to the ground and we couldn’t see anything. I could only hear the shots, I didn’t raise my head, they had forbidden us to look, and I said to myself, “If I get up or do anything like that, it’s over.” My mother still had her arm around me and was holding me tight, she didn’t speak, and they started to shoot at us, one shot at a time. I didn’t hear any groans, no noise. They were shooting, shooting. I thought I was hearing the shots coming closer and I could see, I could feel a head jerk. I could feel it was getting closer, it was getting closer… I could feel the heat. And then it hit my mother, I felt her body jerk, two-three times, I don’t remember how many, I think they shot at her three times and I didn’t hear any noise, she didn’t make any noise, “and now it’s my turn,” I said to myself, “it’s me, it’s my turn.” And I heard like a—the ground trembled, and I felt, close to my face, the sensation of heat, and then very close, between my legs, the ground trembled, my body was still tense, and then it continued on to the next person. It continued on, there were three more people, it passed on to them. It was like I was trying to feel the pain, as if I was trying to—I tried to move, to see where I was hurt, where it—I couldn’t feel anything. I thought, “Maybe I’m already dead.” And I thought that if this was death, maybe it wasn’t so bad, there was no pain. My hand was placed on my mother’s neck, I tried to wake her up, but they were still shooting. I tried to calm down a little. Then finally the shooting stopped, and I heard the sounds of boots. I heard the soldiers speaking: “Go get him too!” And then I heard my father’s voice, coming from somewhere, I could guess where he was standing, he was in front of us, looking at us… He said, “What have you done! Mwakoze iki? Huh! Oya, Mwakoze ibiki!” And then I heard, “Go! We jyenda nawe! Go, you go too.” Then I heard him quickly going down the stairs, trying to escape. He stepped in front of me, right near my head and, yes, I heard footsteps, he ran, and they shot him three or four times. I heard his breathing, the sound of his body falling to the ground, I felt his—I felt his despair, I felt his—I felt that he realized this was the end, I felt all that. He saw his family decimated, he then tried to meet his death head on, and he fell to the ground… I heard his body falling dawn. And that’s when I realized I was alive, that I wasn’t dead, that I was still there and that he had fallen. Then the soldiers, they—I think they were checking to see if we were dead, if anyone was still alive, but they didn’t examine too closely and they continued on their way. They said, “We have to go someplace else, we’ll leave now and we’ll come back.” They left. And while—at that time, I believe, the tension was so intense, that I fainted, I lost consciousness. Maybe ten minutes later, I was awakened by groans, cries from pain. The three zamus were injured. No, actually, two were still alive and one of them was dead. The two were crying out from pain. I also heard my grandfather who was groaning, but the others—silence. My mother was right next to me, but I didn’t dare lift my head. During the whole time, I kept my head to the ground and I had mud, dirt in my mouth, in my nose, my glasses were broken, so I couldn’t see much, and I didn’t breathe. I was breathing heavily, but I tried not to make any noise. I managed to turn my head to look at my mother: her eyes were closed and—she wasn’t moving. I tried to pinch her, I tried to make her move a little, but I saw no sign of life and no sign of suffering—her face was impassive, no blood… I raised my head a little, I saw my grandfather, he was wounded in the arm, his arm was completely—I don’t even know if it was an arm or—it was shredded. And the same thing with his thigh—and he was an old man. It was a horrific scene. I didn’t understand how he could still be alive. The caretakers too were seriously wounded, and were crying out from pain. And I saw that—I asked them if someone—if they can still see the militiamen, if they—I tried talking to them and they said, “No, they are gone!” That’s when I tried to sit up, I felt my body. My hand was a little injured, but I was alive and I had no—I wasn’t seriously hurt. So I tried to—again, I took the initiative; I thought to myself, “I am able to move, I will get them out of here.” I remembered that Dad had been on the phone, he was talking to—before the soldiers arrived, he was talking on the phone with—I didn’t know if he was a minister at the time, but anyway—he was talking to Justin Mugenzi.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"He was the president of the Liberal Party. I remember he was talking to him, so I said to my grandfather, “Dad was talking to Justin, he’s a minister, he can help us, he has soldiers to protect him. I’ve seen him surrounded by soldiers.” Which is more, he lived next door to us. So he [the grandfather] was able to speak, and he—he reached for—he managed to get his address book and gave me Justin’s number. He said, “That’s right, try calling him and tell him we’re wounded.” So I took the number, I ran inside the house, I got to the phone and I called him. His daughter answered, or one of the employees there did, I don’t know. I asked to speak to Justin, I told him very quickly, “We’re wounded, Dad is dead, there is no one left, grandfather is wounded—come quickly!” and I hung up. I went to the window, I didn’t dare going in the garden again, I stayed inside, and I thought, “I just spoke to him, he will come! He will come get us.” I barricaded myself inside the house, I shut the doors closed, I went into the kitchen—it was like I wanted to search the house completely for anyone that might still be there. I went to the kitchen, took a knife and I remember I ran around the house looking for someone who was maybe still there, who had stayed inside, and then I waited. I stationed myself in front of the window overlooking the entrance gate. I waited to see if anyone would come, and then—when—after maybe 10 or 15 minutes, I saw soldiers coming in again, and I recognized their faces. I thought to myself, “The same people are back.” And I thought, “But why are the same people back?” I thought about that for a few seconds, I didn’t understand why they came back—I had spoken with Justin—why hadn’t he come? And then I said to myself, “They’ll look for me and they won’t find me downstairs with the others. I have to hide.” I hid in the attic, it was very high up, but I found inexplicable strength and managed to climb. I hid there and waited. I was hiding in the attic and I was waiting… I could hear them walking around the house, looking for me. And then they stood in front of the bodies and started shooting, they were shooting at the bodies—they shot dead my grandfather, they shot dead the zamus and I think they even shot the others again because they were shooting so much. Then they shot the windows of the house, to make me come out. When they understood that I wasn’t going to come out, they didn’t try to go inside again, they left. They left, and I stayed in the attic, traumatized. I waited, I panicked, I didn’t know what to do. I think I stayed there, in the attic, for 30 minutes perhaps. I didn’t hear a sound except gunfire in the neighbourhood. And then, 30 minutes later, I heard the voice of one of my classmates, Gustave Mbonyumutwa, we studied together at the École belge, we were in the same class. I could hear him, he was talking to me, he said, “Kiko, it’s me, I came to get you. Come! Don’t be afraid.” I didn’t move. I didn’t understand why he was there, what was he doing there. He walked around the house and I could hear him speak with someone else, and then I noticed he was accompanied by a soldier—from the attic, I could hear what was going on in the house. He kept calling me, “Kiko, come out, don’t be afraid! You’re not risking anything.” Some minutes passed, I thought to myself, “If I stay here, I will certainly die, so I might as well go downstairs and be done with it. What good is my life now, anyway?” So, I went downstairs. I went downstairs and I saw him standing in front of the entrance and I spoke to him, I said, “Are you sure that nothing will happen to me? Are you sure that—why is there a soldier here, with you? What will he do to me?” He said, “No, he’s here for our safety, I’m going to take you to my house uptown”—they lived a little further up, in Kicukiro. He said, “I’m going to take you home, you’ll be safe.” He said, “I know what happened, you’ll come home with me.” Well, I said—I opened the door, I went outside and nothing happened. He said, “Follow me, the soldier will walk behind us, he will act as if he had found us and he’s taking us somewhere to—” So, we left the house. I remember I quickly took with me one jacket and a few small items, documents, I think, my identity papers. And then I left with him. We walked up the road to his house and we passed by groups of men in the street, the soldiers were everywhere. He took me to Matayo Ngirumpatse’s house—the houses were—Mbonyumutwa [inaudible]. It was—they lived next door to each other, and our house was not too far either. And since we knew each other a little bit—my mother knew Mathieu’s [Matayo?] wife—so I thought that—and Mathieu’s daughter was also at the École belge, like me—so I felt reassured, I felt a little bit safe, except when we got there, there were tanks, plenty of soldiers and—but at least I recognized the faces of people I knew from school. I stayed there. When I entered the house, I saw a whole bunch of people that I didn’t know, men that I hadn’t met yet, but Gustave’s dad, Shingiro Mbonyumutwa, was also there, he came up to me, shook my hand and said, “My condolences.” I remember those were his first words to me. He said, “My condolences.” So he was already aware of everything that had happened—but why is he telling me that? He knew that my parents were dead. In any case, it was a—I felt—I was shaken, in a state of shock. But nothing happened in that house, he even treated my wound. I was wounded here [shows his wrist] and they treated me, they gave me food, and an hour or two later Rose, Matthew’s wife who knew my family, handed me the phone and said, “It’s your brother in Belgium, he wants to talk to you.” I said, “You called him already? What am I going to tell him?” She said, “Tell him what happened.” So I took the phone, and—Sam was on the other end of the line and he said, “Are you okay? What are you doing there? Is everything all right?” I didn’t know what to say, I was searching for my words, and then I think I told him, “Our parents are dead.” Then I think I heard the sound of a person collapsing, I don’t know, a noise… Later, I learned that he had to sit down from the shock, he was a little—and then he asked me to repeat, “What?” “Our parents are dead, and I’m wounded, and I’m here, but—” Just pronouncing the words “our parents are dead” was already the—I had said everything. I don’t think we talked about anything else. I handed the phone back to Rose and she hung up or she spoke to him—I don’t remember anymore… I stayed there that night. I slept there. The next day, they had to take me to the—I think they contacted the Belgians or they called UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda], but I think no one was able to come to the house because of the gunfire and all that. I think the gunfire was getting closer and—we had to move, we had to leave the house because they themselves were no longer safe. So I followed everyone, the whole group that fled Matayo’s house where we were; there were other people there, many, many other people, refugees. We left in a single file and we went downtown, we went past the house where I lived. I asked that we stop there so that I could go in and get some things that I wanted to take with me. There was also something that was bothering me: the dead bodies were in the garden and it had rained; I said to myself, “Can we cover them with something?” So even at 17 years old I thought—I already had that—like I had a mission: I had to cover them. I went back to the house and I went inside, I got my father’s passports, some important documents, identity papers, and then we covered the bodies quickly because we had to hurry up, the gunfire was approaching, and it was very dangerous at that point. I went back in the car and then the whole row of vehicles left. We drove through the city centre, we drove to what was at the time the Hôtel des Diplomates, and everyone—it was like a refugee camp, everyone was there. It was full of people. A lot of people. But I was alone, and I don’t know who called the United Nations, the Belgian army. All I know is that a Belgian army jeep was waiting for me and I got in. And while I was walking in corridors of the Hôtel des Diplomates, going towards the Jeep, I ran into Justin Mugenzi. I remember that we walked past each other, he looked at me, he looked at me, we walked past each other, then he turned away. We did not speak. But the expression on his face was like saying, “What are you doing here?” Or, “How come you are here, what is—” No explanation about what had happened. In short, I found myself in the Belgian army jeep and they brought me to the Belgian refugee camp. A small improvised camp for the families of the Belgians was set up in front of the École belge. There, yes, I found a younger cousin who was—whose father was Belgian too, so we reunited there. And from then on I was alone with my little cousin. I think we slept there one more night. So I stayed for two nights after the 7th, so on the 9th, all the Belgians—I ended up with the Belgians, the foreigners—and all the French who were there too—we left in a military convoy with the French army towards the airport and we took the back roads, we didn’t take the main roads, the main streets, but we ended up reaching the airport. And then we left. I arrived in Belgium and—once there, well, I met with my brother and sister at the airport. Yes, that’s about it… Anyway.",Interviewee,Tension

A team of psychologists was also there to help the people who needed care, but I have always refused—I don’t—I have always refused the help of psychologists, I don’t know why. I’ve always wanted to heal by myself, but—maybe because I simply didn’t feel sick. There was this one psychologist who came up to me many times, and she would always say, “Frédéric, come to see me!” Sometimes I went to her house and her children were around, she made me feel comfortable. She would say, “You can talk to me if you want to.” But every time I would start to talk, I would stop. I didn’t find it was something I needed. Maybe I should have done it, I don’t know, but it’s—I didn’t like talking about what had happened, I didn’t like telling my story.

Maybe I drew my strength from her. And especially the fact that she gave her life for me, I have the feeling that I have internalized that, I have her strength, she infused something in me, and often when I have problems, when I don’t feel well, I think of her, and it’s like she is talking to me, saying, “It will be okay, persevere, it will be okay, keep going, we’re here.” I feel her support in this way.",Interviewee,Tension

In fact, I knew only one person, a Canadian, who was also proficient in the Rwandan language.

I try to tell myself that—well, it’s true that God—God—ultimately, that’s a big question, it’s quite, uh—but I don’t think religion can provide answers for everything—not for everything.

He even knew that the soldiers had arrived at our house, but he couldn’t come to us, he was under surveillance. At one point he was able to come out from where he was, and he managed to save—one of our cousins says that he came to get her and brought her to the Hôtel Mille Collines—so he did save some people, but he was under surveillance and his hands were tied. During the genocide the interahamwe were split into two factions: the hardliners and those who wanted out. And I think he was among those trying to sneak out, but that doesn’t diminish his role in this. And my story—often because—are we still recording? Oh, okay. One day, around the time when the Mugenzi verdict came out, lawyers from the International Tribunal contacted me and said, “You can testify at the trial and say that he was the one who saved you, after all, that he sent his guards to save you.” They contacted me several times, they tried to come over and bring me to the trial to testify, and it’s really—I’m in a situation where—well, people on both sides try to use me. But what I said to the person was—I said, “When I called him [that day], I didn’t know at all who he was, I didn’t know him. I only knew he was a minister. I lived in a bubble, I didn’t know what his work was, what he did. And when I called him, it really was to save myself. What happened was that he sent soldiers who came to eliminate—they came to finish off the—my grandfather and the others who were still alive, and they didn’t even—they scared me, they fired gunshots in the house, they—how can we be sure that it wasn’t him who had sent them to kill me, to erase all traces?” That’s what I said every time they asked me. On the other hand, another family sent me questions through an [inaudible: intermediary?]. The Mbonyumutwa family was criticizing me, saying that I wasn’t grateful because their son was the one who came to get me out of the house. Except that—being grateful for what? For a classmate’s natural reaction towards another human being, who says, “I know him, I will save him”? Is it because their son saved me that the family isn’t guilty of anything or the father isn’t guilty of anything? In my view, we must think about this a little, we must put things in perspective and—I’m sure that’s also something that they must consider for themselves: “He isn’t grateful that we saved his life.” But their rescue came too late, they could have saved me a little earlier—and save my parents at the same time.

And she asks, “Acting as a human being—is that what heroism is?” The natural thing to do is not to let people kill children, not let them kill those who are innocent and preventing that—is that what we call heroism? It’s not.

Still, it is quite—if I were in their place, I would have done exactly the same, but I wouldn’t have boasted that I am a hero, that I have saved so and so. The facts are there. Even if we can’s apply the same sentence to a child, someone who—let’s take Mbonyumutwa’s case—he said blatant things on the radio, his message was full of hate, but I can’t judge children by the same standard, because in my mind children are innocent and I would say “thank you” to the person who has saved me if I meet him on the street one day, but to the family—the people who have committed—who have spoken on the radio, who have uttered messages of hate—even my uncle—that’s why I said that it’s better that he died because if he were still alive I don’t think I would have forgiven him. And if I had to go to court, I would have stood there and accused him, I would have been the witness of—I would have testified because we have to fight this ideology, the ideology of eliminating people on the pretext that they are—whether they belong to this or that ethnicity or whether they represent this or that group.

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Well, I lived in Belgium for ten years and I would summarize those ten years in Belgium like this: I tried to find my path, I got closer to my family in Belgium whom I didn’t know very well, I grew closer to them, my mental health improved, so to speak. And then it just so happened that I crossed paths with my wife, Sylvie Gasana, in Rwanda while I was there for the holidays. And we kept in touch for years while I was living in Belgium. After a few years she came here, to Canada, to study. I visited her during the holidays and I finally decided to move here. So, it’s for a reason close to my heart that I am here, and I also liked the city. I moved here, so—it was an easy thing to do and for me it represents, really, a second, even a third life. After life in Rwanda, the genocide, the life of adaptation in Belgium, for me Canada is a like the life of the—things are like—",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"There are, however, problems in the Rwandan community here. Obviously, there are many things related to your integration here, but if we focus just on the Rwandan community, how do you see the relations between the Rwandans who live here? The Hutus, the Tutsis, or the negationist tendencies? Specifically—yes, Canada is a country that is open, that gives people much freedom, but maybe because of this open-mindedness, some may go too far precisely because they live in a country of great openness—",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"I am for freedom of expression, so blocking out the deniers, preventing them from speaking, will—it will just bring more attention to them. Why would we prevent them from speaking? Allowing them to express their point of view will also allow those who disagree with their ideas to immediately say out loud that they make no sense, and the topic will be dropped. But as long as an idea remains hidden, we don’t know what it is and we can’t know if it’s good or not. So, certainly, in the Rwandan community, there is a tendency to—well, it really is split into two groups, that is still clear. The two groups are present among both young and old [members of the community]. Well, the young try to make a greater effort than the old, but it’s not easy because then there is this negationist current that is felt and partly currently fed, I believe, by the crisis in Congo; the Congolese who get involved, who lean towards the Hutu side, who try to push them. But personally, I try to talk with everyone, I don’t really have a preference. For sure, I have more Tutsi friends, for obvious reasons, it’s normal—I’m talking about my family, my circle of friends, they are Tutsi, for the most part, but it had never really mattered to me, I try to stay clear of politics. But you can still see it in Montreal, something is happening, a separation, that will lead, I think, to what is occurring in Belgium, for example, where there really are two different groups that—I think the same is going to happen here—it’s quite strong in Europe and I think Canada will not be spared, so it’s—",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"The groups don’t talk to each other, each ethnic group has its bars they go to—there is a bar for the Hutus and a bar for the Tutsis. But I tend to follow the path of the Rwandan government, not talking about it and integrating everyone. After what we’ve lived through, it doesn’t—I don’t know, what’s the point of going back to that? For me, that’s rhetoric of the past and it’s a pity that people [inaudible: buy into?] it, it’s—we really need to move forward and—but the important thing is—every time I speak with a Hutu friend, if I don’t get an insight into his opinion about the genocide, we can’t become friends. Something that needs to be clear, whether with the Hutus or the Tutsis, is this: there was a genocide, it was committed by the Hutus to eliminate all Tutsis. That is clear. If we are to modify this view, that’s something I use as a basis to decide whether to become friends with someone or not. Yeah.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"In terms of my story, my experience, yes, well— [short break in the recording]  I don’t talk about my story constantly, every day, but my family, my wife’s family here in Canada, they are well aware of what I have lived through, and I took solace, so to speak—I found a family again, after losing mine, and that’s what has always motivated me since the loss of my parents: I’ve always wanted to rebuild my family, to recover a little bit the emotions that I felt before and, uh, I’ve grown. We were a big family, we would get together, we had family gatherings every week and I rediscovered that here, with my wife’s family, and it’s very nice, it’s comforting. When I speak about it, I can freely tell my story and it’s important that the children—when my daughter is old enough to understand more serious things, I will tell her about it and I will especially like to teach her the neutral values ​​of the—about what happened in Rwanda. To explain things in a concrete way, but without fueling hatred. If every parent did that, I think the results would be good. To live with the past, with the wounds of the past and to pass them on to another generation, that’s not helpful at all. We see it in conflicts around the world and it doesn’t help, it only perpetuates hatred. And I think that if we, the survivors like myself, can advance this message and say, “Well, we’ve suffered, we’re not even going to ask for your forgiveness, but the future generations and us, we are even now, so we are going to stop this.” I think that can give us some sense of peace. But what is important is the recognition of what happened, the negationism is not—cannot be tolerated. For me, that’s the basis for—if that’s something we don’t recognize, it’s—a dialogue is not possible—but—yeah, that’s it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, it’s—you want to scream to their face, to shake them, to—but my feeling is that responding with violence won’t change anything, the best we can do is, I think, to have a discussion. And especially us, the survivors, especially the people who have suffered, the first victims, so to speak—it is our mission to talk about it, to say, “It really happened, there really was a genocide, this is what happened to me, this is what happened to others.” Talking about it. And, in relation to that, if—I believe that the negationist message will be silenced. That is why, I don’t think it’s right to prevent these people from speaking, because the message will then never be buried and it will continue [to be spread] within their families and little by little they will—while if they speak openly about it, okay, the message is in the public sphere, for everyone to see and hear and it is up to us to do the groundwork, to say, “They say this, but our experience is different.” And I believe that an eyewitness account compared to a negationist message—which is non-existent, or which is nothing more than words—I believe that a lived story is stronger than an invented story. We do not rewrite History. History exists and there are people for whom it is a concrete lived experience and we are here to say that out loud. The more numerous we are, the more that negationist message will be silenced, but we must talk about it and, by the way, that’s what I often say to my cousins ​​in Rwanda who don’t want to talk about what happened, or who are still hurting deeply, or who dare not talk about it: to talk, to get it out, to tell what happened—that’s very important.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"When I was there, I met many of my old friends and they feel a little abandoned by all these new Rwandans who have arrived from abroad and who haven’t really taken the time to integrate them, to integrate these older Rwandans who had been there, we call them “the Sopecyas.” It’s as if the country has begun anew; we started from zero and we forgot everything that was there before. The older ones, they are a little overlooked. I often talk with my friends who live there and it’s as if no one wants to hear their stories anymore, they’re told to forget it all and to—that it’s a return to the past. I hear that often, this message, this discourse: to forget and to move on. But every month of April, these people—well, April is a month of mourning and we can’t ignore the genocide, I think, even if we become—even if one day we become the richest country in Africa or something like that, the genocide will always be part of Rwandan history and the people who have experienced it directly must be placed front and centre in connection to it, they must be respected, they must respect their rights because they are [inaudible] that open and they really are the first victims of the genocide.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"No. But the example I usually give is of a friend who was wounded during the genocide, he had been hit with a machete all over his body. He’s still in pain from his injuries and he’s struggling to live his life, to find work, just to find a house, to find something to eat, he’s always chasing after a job—he’s trying to survive. There are organizations and things in place for the survivors, but it’s—it’s either badly managed or it’s not efficient enough, or, anyway—and his injuries hadn’t healed completely, he would often show me his scars and I’d think to myself, “Isn’t the government helping you heal or shouldn’t it send you abroad for treatment?” Well, time passed, his injuries worsened and—there are things in place, I know that there are organizations to help the survivors, but it looks like they are not doing enough. If this person came here, abroad, he would have been treated, he would lead a more pleasant life. Sometimes I have the impression that all genocide survivors are left to fend for themselves, that they have been abandoned. We take for granted that “it’s all over now, everyone has healed, we must move on,” but it’s not possible, eh, we must—there are people who are still sick, who are suffering, but who don’t speak about it simply because they don’t have the framework or the—there are no resource people for that, to help them with that.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE FRÉDÉRIC MUGWANEZA.-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yeah, our Rwandan mentality is to be a little withdrawn; we don’t like to talk about our lives just like that. But I say to myself that the more eyewitness accounts there are, the more—those people, precisely, who are a little inward-looking, who don’t want to tell their story, they would look up to us as an example and would speak up. And the more stories are told, the more—because talking is healing; through talking we sometimes find answers, if we don’t, well, at least the people who heard what we had to say can help us. But for sure if we don’t talk, it’s—living is more difficult, life is harder and there is—and especially when you’re in Africa or Rwanda, it’s even harder, that’s for sure, yeah.",Interviewee,Tension

I can also understand that we cannot be worrying only about the sick and the survivors, and making sure that all is well—there is also a country to rebuild, no doubt, but there has been a lot of international aid—aid that was directed especially towards the survivors. I’m not saying that all is bad, because many projects worked out well, for sure, but my impression is that we’re not doing enough. We’re not doing enough and we don’t give survivors a chance to succeed in life. Many of their anchor points have changed: the language is in the process of—many of the survivors are francophones and now Rwanda is switching to English. Also, the mentality, the old Rwandans’ ways of doing things are different from those of the Rwandans who have just arrived. So some of their bearings have been lost, that’s for sure.

How could we…, how did you see that coming?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"... In fact, I think it was already happening in the Gisenyi region. There was this period called Zulu. I don’t remember which year, but it was between 1980… I think it was 1993. But at the school where I was …, in high school in Nyundo ... very close to the cathedral, the Bishop of Nyundo at that time, the Monseigneur, had given refuge to the Bagogwe who had been chased from their region where ... well, from their homes. So when we went to Mass in Nyundo, we saw those refugees who were refugees inside their own country and who were there not because they were bad people, but because they were Tutsi. And so, in Gisenyi during this Operation Zulu…, I remember that after that period, many Tutsis who had the financial means left Gisenyi and moved to Kigali. And there were displaced children in my high school, displaced because of the war of the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front], and from time to time they were ... showing hatred for their Tutsi classmates. My classroom was ... actually ... I didn’t really see much … I didn’t see anything going on in the classroom. But since we were at a boarding school, we could see that small groups were forming. I remember one time, I was with two other girls, we walked by a small [group?] of children, some of whom had been displaced by the war, and I remember we saw them spit on the ground. But it was just ... it was an insult directed at us. At the junior seminary, there were things ...—the seminary was nearby—things of the same nature were happening there too. People, students, were sharing stories in the evenings. And the atmosphere was starting to get tense because of that. And, I think, when I look back at that time now, these are the kinds of events that foreshadowed the worst to come. But at the same time, I didn’t think about it too much. I don’t know if at some point you get used to living with things like this. But also, not all Hutu children were like that. I remember in one of my groups there was a girl, actually, several girls with whom we were often together and we never really noticed any animosity against us. So, those things were ... were there, they weren’t widespread yet, but we could really ... we could understand them if we wanted to see the situation as it really was. But, once again, you had to close your eyes and, you know, ... move on. When 1994 happened I was both lucky and unlucky. My luck was that I wasn’t at home. So, prior to 1994, I had run away from home and I had met some of the nuns from the Auxiliaries of the Apostolate, after which I returned home. So from time to time I would spend the holidays at the convent. And it was Easter in 1994, so I was going to spend my second week of vacation with these nuns. I left home on Easter Monday and the genocide began on the 7th. But I remember that already on the 6th, the night of the 6th, one of the priests came to pay a visit to one of his friends among the auxiliaries. And as he was there, we were told…—since the routine in this convent was to get up in the morning and go to the church to attend Mass. So every morning, we went to Mass. By chance, this priest was there and the priest said—actually, one of the nuns told me: “Since the priest is here, he’ll celebrate Mass at the convent, so you don’t have to go to the church tomorrow morning, the Mass will be held here.” So we got up to go to the Mass and the first thing the priest told us was, “The president’s plane has been shot down.” Everyone was ... I was surrounded by adults and later that day, sitting around the table, we continued discussing the news and I remember I said, “It’s over.” Today, every time I think about why I said “It's over,” I don’t understand why I said it.

Do you have news of this or that person?” People would abruptly go into the room, they would go in ... and talk in low voices behind locked doors. Others would be listening to the radio ... they were trying to capture [?] to find out what was going on. Still others spent time in the chapel. And it was in this atmosphere…, but since I knew the house well… and actually, later the female students of Saint-Fidèle University also sought refuge at the convent and other people from the city who could reach the Saint-Pierre Centre, came as well. And since I was…, since I knew the place better than others, I continued to help. I helped with the cooking and with the housework. I continued participating in the life of the convent as I did before, so ... I kept myself busy and I didn’t really have time to stop. It’s only now that I stop and become frozen ... at that time, I was much more in the action.

My mother brought some money and I ... right away, I don’t know why, but I felt afraid for my father. And my mother was a sociable person and she had a lot of friends. I always had the impression that maybe… And she had an MRMD (the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development) membership card, but my father had an RPF card.

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, life continued. Well, I can’t know everything that was going on in the communes, but we knew that the Tutsis were targeted, that it was about the Tutsis. I don’t remember being hustled by any of the Hutus who were in the convent. Even though Félicité and Nathalie went to—in fact, on account of these students from Saint-Fidèle —I remember they went to get another Saint-Fidèle student who was injured and was in the hospital and they brought her to the convent where she was treated. And Félicité had sent two Hutu nuns to my parents’ house. Upon their arrival, they found out that my parents had been killed, but they didn’t tell me that when they came back. And I don’t know if they had tried to save them or what, but I know that the next day Félicité asked me, “Do you know anyone in Congo? Do you, by any chance, have family there?” I said yes—that was around April 19–20. I told her that and she said “okay.” I think it was on the night of April 19 to 20 when she told me, “Don’t go to sleep tonight.” Actually prior to that date my brother had come—my younger brother, Jean-Baptiste, had arrived at the convent. And she told me that on the 7th, on April 7th, a classmate of mine from elementary school, whose brother was taking part in the killings [a génocidaire], had said, “You know what? All Tutsis will die.” And then my brother had told my parents, “I'm leaving.” And my mother had said, “Okay, go to this family.” One of my mother’s cousins had a husband whom we didn’t know if he was Hutu or Tutsi. Afterwards, I received written information confirming he was Tutsi, but at that time we thought he was Hutu. So, my ... then my mother had said [to my brother], “If you’re going there, take Marie-Ange with you.” And so…",Interviewee,Tension

And so Jean-Baptiste went with Marie-Ange to Jacqueline’s house, but once there, Jacqueline's husband told Jean-Baptiste: “We'll keep Marie-Ange, but we can’t keep both of you. Do you know where Berthe is?” Jean-Baptiste said yes. “Okay, go to her.” So, Jean-Baptiste came to where I was staying, but on the way there, he met someone who asked him: “You are Alexis’ son, aren’t you?” My brother said, “No, I'm not Alexis’ son.” After that he arrived at the convent and so we were both staying there together. And one night Félicité told us not to go to bed. Later, around midnight, she came back and said: “Okay, you can go to sleep now, we were just told that there are militiamen everywhere and you can’t cross [the border].” She wanted us to cross over to Congo where she had sent about fifteen people already and she wanted to try that a second time, but it didn’t work. So until the 21st…, when the militiamen came to the convent, so around 3–4 pm… I was in the kitchen, and Félicité came running: “Tell everyone to hide, the assassins are here.” I ran around the convent saying, “Hide! Hide!” I hadn’t even finished saying that when the génocidaires arrived and I was then saying that I wasn’t Tutsi. They brought us to … one of them took me along with several others and there was ... they were people all over the place, so the militiamen had ordered many of the people to come out from their hiding places. I went to the exit door and I saw many people on their knees and a ... a killer pointing his rifle in their direction. They told us to kneel and we did. They had two minibuses parked outside the convent and we were told to get on the bus. I fought back. One of the killers was bringing people in ... and I said, “Don’t hit me.” Félicité hadn’t gotten on the bus yet, and they forced her to. So we left with the first bus and they told us that they were going to take us to the red commune. Inside the bus—one of the nuns had been teaching us a song—so I started singing it and then we were told to keep quiet because “You killed President Habyarimana, so you don’t get to sing. The only Hutu who’s on the bus can continue singing.” So, we took ... the driver took the road to the cemetery.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,So that’s what the red commune was?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"That was the red commune. And on the way there, we saw that, outside, life for some people was ... continuing. While you are on the bus heading to certain death, right next to you—in any case, for the Hutus—life hadn’t changed, the market was open and you could see people in the street; at the time when you were afraid to come out of your hiding place and we were going to ... to the cemetery. And when we arrived, many people ... came to assist. On arrival, I also saw militiamen coming out of the [inaudible] with machetes, even with old, traditional machetes… And in the bus I had…, I had learned the name of one of the ... well, the name of the bus driver ... well, of my killer, a militiaman, and someone was saying ... who was saying, “But Thomas, don’t you recognize me? Don’t you know I'm from such and such a place?” I remember that. But I also remember that they didn’t really want to kill Félicité, because while we were driving, they said: “The colonel's sister must not go on the bus.” But she had insisted, “If you're going to kill these people, I'm going with them.” At the same time, even though the colonel's sister had to get off the bus, they never forced her out—it was just empty words. So when we got to the cemetery, I thought, “Maybe they won’t kill her.” So I got off the bus, took her hand, and we all got out. The others got out and immediately lied down on the ground. One man, about thirty years old, tried to escape, but the génocidaires ran after him and caught him. It’s one of the most vicious images I have from that moment. They caught him and he was held on both sides by two génocidaires and two others ... were ... cutting him, and everyone was watching. So, in the meantime, Félicité, who, I imagine, didn’t really want to see that whole scene ... let go of my hand and she turned away…—the cemetery was at the foot of a mountain—and so she gazed up towards the mountain as if in a prayer. So, when she let go of my hand ... I took Thomas’ hands, the bus driver. And Thomas took my hand too. I saw in the crowd a former classmate of mine from elementary school, and I made a sign with my hand, like that [makes a sign with her hands] to ask for help and he did this [makes a sign of helplessness], meaning, he couldn’t do anything. And while Thomas was holding my hand, one of the killers snatched me from Thomas’ hands and Thomas kicked him. In the meantime we realized that Omar, who is now in Arusha, was shooting those who were lying on the ground. There was a child there, about two years old, and Thomas, who was holding my hand, told me to take the child and go back on the bus. A few of the génocidaires had stayed behind in the bus, there was also another girl in there—she was the child’s aunt, but she didn’t want to reveal her identity, anyways, the child’s aunt…",Interviewee,Tension

At the moment when I took the child to get on the bus, I saw Félicité falling to the ground, and at the same time I saw the priest—the same priest who celebrated Mass on the first day, who had stayed with us at the Saint-Pierre Centre—I saw him approaching with three policemen to save Félicité, but it was too late. So we got back on the bus and ... and it was over. Omar returned to the bus with Thomas, the driver, and we started on our way back. While we were driving Omar asked Thomas what was I doing in the bus and Thomas replied: “She just lied to me that she is Tutsi.” Omar said, “You have to stop the bus, I have to kill her too.” But Thomas didn’t ... didn’t stop the bus.

The next day, actually, that same evening, several soldiers came by to ask how Félicité had died and it was as if she was the only person who had died. I tried to tell them what had happened, but I didn’t know that they had captured several of the killers. And the next day, Félicité's brother and some of his friends went to dig up Félicité’s body and give her a dignified burial, among the thousands of dead bodies. And the people, the Hutu sisters who were there, later told us that all the corpses were naked. And on that same evening of April 22, we ... sought refuge in Congo. We decided ..., we decided to leave with the few people who were still at the convent. In the meantime, my brother had gone out of the convent and when he came back we told him to come to Congo with us, but he refused.

Around five o'clock in the morning, we set out towards the houses in Birere, in Goma and we arrived at a church, I think it was a Pentecostal church. We went inside and ... those who were there could see that we were people escaping death. There was a Tutsi woman who was living in Congo and she decided to take care of me, and it was as if everyone found a place to go. There were several female students from Saint-Fidèle ... and there was one who was studying at the Adventist university at the time and she said, “I'm going over there to join the Adventists.” And I … When Félicité had asked me if I knew anyone in Congo, she was thinking of sending me first to Goma, to a nun who had left with the first group, among those who … And I said, “Can you take me to the bishop or do you know Adria?” And that’s how many of us were sent to different places. I was with Immaculée, one of the nuns who was Tutsi, and with Adria—actually, the nun brought us to the episcopal see in Goma where Adria and the other sisters came to see me. And we went to Adria’s family in Goma—there were several of us from the Saint-Pierre Centre. On May 3, the orphanage in Nyundo was evacuated. After our departure from the convent, Nathalie brought my brother and three other kids whose mother had left with the first group [inaudible] to this orphanage. So when the evacuees from the Nyundo orphanage arrived in Goma, my brother was among them. I then demanded to go to the orphanage in Goma and so we left this family and went to the orphanage. Later, in May ... my uncle who was in Bukavu, found out where I was and sent his wife to come and pick me up. But he thought that I was the only one there from the family. When his wife arrived and when she saw that my brother was also there, she said, “Okay, I'll take you both to Bukavu.” ... So she signed me out from the orphanage to bring us to Bukavu. And on the same day we signed all the papers in order to leave the orphanage and after we left the orphanage and were going to spend the night in Goma before leaving the next day to Bukavu, ... my friends from the orphanage came to tell me, “Your three brothers just arrived at the orphanage with the Red Cross.” And so I went back to the orphanage. We couldn’t get a place in the orphanage again easily because there were many children there. But with luck, some would leave [and we could take their place]. I said, “I’m not leaving” ... they were trying to convince me that I had to leave because the director… that we couldn’t ... that we couldn’t have a place there anymore ... that the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] had to sort this out.

The children will stay at the orphanage and you ... you will go to your uncle’s.” I said that was not possible, so I [inaudible] [laughs]. At one point, there was a priest who intervened, Abbé Martin ... Abbé Martin who knew someone at the UNHCR, I think. The nuns, my uncle's wife and I were in the process of trying to get permission, and then Martin intervened and after his intervention, the UNHCR ... allowed me to go back to the orphanage, and so we stayed there.

And when I arrived, Jacqueline said, “You have to be very careful.” So, we found Marie-Ange who was ... not looking well, she had been jostled around.

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"[laughs] I’m an eternal rebel. I said to myself, “I will not stay here.” You know, you’re in the orphanage and you ... after I left [?] when the Notre Dame lycée opened in Nyundo, and since it was very close to the orphanage, I went back so that I can be closer to my brothers and sisters. But when you’re in the orphanage and then you go to high school, and everything is within a well-defined area, so you're really ... it felt like two prisons and sometimes I would just leave, I would go to my uncle’s and my uncle [would say]: “But where is it that you are going? You have to stay at the orphanage.” And I would say, “Okay.” So, since my third year in secondary school, I’d had the idea to get out of the orphanage, and I was hoping that it would happen miraculously after high school [laughs]. So I studied like crazy in my third year, I never worked as hard in school as I worked that year. After the genocide, I thought, “I’ll finish school fast and I’ll leave the orphanage.” I thought that I would get a job right away and that everything would happen naturally. I made contacts with people outside of the orphanage. And later, when I learned that I had a half-sister and that she was living with her maternal aunt in Kigali, I went to look for her in Kigali and when I found her, she said: “Oh, I have a very good friend here and you must meet her before you go back to Nyundo.” So, [inaudible] she is my sister's friend and she is really a very warm person and she told me, “If you want to come to my house during the school break, the doors are open.” And she was someone I had just met! [laughs] I said, “Okay.” So, from time to time during the holidays…, I ... we kept in touch. And 1997–1998 was ... the period of the infiltrators, it was still a dangerous time in Gisenyi. They were burning buses, so it really was another war. And I thought, “We can’t die now!” I was knocking on people’s doors, I couldn’t see ... I went to my maternal uncle in Bukavu and I said, “We can’t stay there, in this chaos of shooting. It might not seem scary to you, but if our fate is to die now, we should do everything we can so that at least some of us are saved.” My uncle tried to find an orphanage, but he wasn’t able to. And my friends, well, the families of my classmates were also trying to find an SOS orphanage in Kigali, but we made the mistake of saying that we were leaving one orphanage to go to another and the SOS told us, “We don’t take children from another orphanage.” So I didn’t know what to do, but I kept in touch with this woman and she told me, “You can bring your three sisters, Marie-Ange and, well, at least the youngest children.” And this was not something we did at home. It’s a family ..., well, after a genocide, anything is possible, but when I told my uncle about it, he said: “My goodness!” [laughs] And he turned to my two other brothers and asked: “So, what do you think—your sister is doing well, isn’t she?” But I didn’t care ... I didn’t care about what the others might say. I said to my younger brother, “You will sign as if…”—it was clear that my relation with the director of the orphanage was strained because of these comings and goings, so I didn’t dare showing up there and [I said to] my younger brother: “You're going to sign as if it were my uncle, you'll say that it's my uncle who…”",Interviewee,Tension

And Marie-Ange, Jean-Yves and Yvan were [inaudible] in primary school in Muhima and they went to live [inaudible] with this family that we had just met [laughs].

Jean-Baptiste and Gaétan stayed at the orphanage or went to my uncle's house, but the rest of us, we stayed with this family.

And it was there that we started addressing our problem that we were ... that we were nearly homeless. So I started the process. At that time, in the beginning of the FARG, I had a friend from high school whose cousin was a secretary at the FARG—a secretary who later married the secretary general of the FARG at that time. So we opened a file on our case and they said, “Okay, we can pay you the rent for a house.” So, we agreed with our host family that we would look for a house nearby so we wouldn’t be far and the family would know what was going on with us. We started looking for a house near where we were ... near Donatille’s family who had welcomed us. And so, in 1999, we started living in…",Interviewee,No Tension

At one point the FARG told us, “We can’t just keep giving you charity, you have to do a project.” So we did a project ... to help ourselves, but that was also the time when I went searching for our maternal aunts. One of our aunts had a good situation at the time, and when she came to see us, she said, “Okay, but there’s three of us in the family. Why don’t you split—everything is going to be simpler that way?” So ... and Donatille said to me: “That's not good.” But I was all excited to have found more relatives, and I think that was a serious mistake I made with regards to my younger brothers. So I said, “Okay, we can disperse within the family.” We split—I think it was in 2001, so from 1999 until 2001 we were ... or until mid-2000 we were alone. So the aunts…, so we dispersed. I went to live close to the university with my university colleagues and my brothers were in the host families, so at my aunts’ houses. But one of the aunts had AIDS and we didn’t know that, and shortly afterwards she ... she died. And it was she who, at least financially ... she had a difficult character, but she helped us a lot financially, she supported just about everyone. And that's when it became difficult because it was this other aunt who then took care of my brothers. That aunt had a husband in prison, so she had her own problems. And she took in my brothers as well as the children of my aunt who had just died. So the children survivors were living with other children as well as with the children whose father was in prison—even if they were all family, it wasn’t easy. And my younger brothers Jean-Baptiste, Jean-Yves and Yvan suffered a lot. They stayed there until I graduated from university and, once again, I went to the FARG.

I had one room in the university dorm—I couldn’t. The other children were deeply affected, but we have a good laugh about it today. But things were not going well at all at the time.

Earlier in the interview Monique asked you who had influenced you the most, your father or your mother, but it’s not only your parents who’ve had most influence on you. Among the people close to you during all this, who were those who had a positive impact on you and, perhaps, a negative one? But talk first about the positive.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"... I think there were many people like that and ... at different moments. I think, for example, before 1994, when I met Félicité and the other nuns, it was initially another nun who introduced me to Félicité and she was around 60 years old. At the time I was only 11 and I was dealing with family situations that I didn’t accept and she welcomed me and took the time to talk to me as if she was talking to an equal and she treated me ... treated me with me a very positive attitude, a compassionate and welcoming disposition. And especially ... to also see how she treated everyone, not just me. She was someone who ... who knew ... who took care of some of the vulnerable people in the town. I remember there was an elderly woman who did not leave her home and that nun was taking care of her. She was paying someone to stay with the lady—I think one of the other nuns was staying with her, but she supported the elderly lady in her needs. It was the nun’s simplicity and especially her disposition towards others that were remarkable. And during the genocide nothing in her behaviour changed. And I think that knowing that—despite how broken we were by the events—I think knowing that gave me confidence in life, as if no matter what happens, I don’t have to necessarily expect the worst and I can believe that even one individual among the thousands can spark brightness. Later, whether at the orphanage or at school, I was lucky to have teachers who always listened to me, who always appreciated me as a student, well, I could see they loved me and that, I think, carried me forward. Also my schoolmates, even when leaving the orphanage, even when ... many people were saying “This child won’t get anywhere. She’s taking her younger brothers out of the orphanage. What will happen to her? She will become mayibobo, she will become ikirara, a street child.” Despite that, my classmates who knew me, and even their families whom I got to know through my classmates, were supportive. And then there was Donatille and her husband Fénariel who welcomed us without knowing us. Donatille was someone exceptional, she was ... a very kind, very generous woman who was really there for us during a difficult time. We ... it's as if we were sisters, we didn’t know each other, but she regarded me as her younger sister and she loved my little brothers as she loved her own children. So, there were many positive things. Today, we’ve moved past this situation and when we look back on it we realize that it has weakened us, but that there were a lot of things that ... that, despite our vulnerability at the time, helped us get where we are today. So, I think that's it. Life here or there, well ... I was living in that situation, but I can’t say that ... that it was dramatic. Perhaps it seemed dramatic on the outside, to the people observing the situation, but I never experienced that. Our situation was what it was, I couldn’t stop and analyze it, so I lived with it and I carried on. But it's really thanks to ... to all these people that I’ve met. And then, when I arrived here, you were here, Emmanuel and Callixte were also here.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"... Actually, after my studies in Rwanda, I got a job in [inaudible] in Kibuye ... but I liked to study, so I entertained the idea that if the opportunity presents itself, I will continue studying. So, I learned that there were scholarships for students from the Francophonie, I applied and I was lucky to get one. The destination was Canada. So that's how we ... [laughs]",Interviewee,Tension

And that’s ... how I could get in touch with Emmanuel and with Callixte with whom I spoke, I think, in the first months after my arrival in Canada. And that’s how it happened. Emmanuel and Callixte asked me to share this experience in public and so here I am with you today! [laughs]",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"... I think a big part of me is still there ..., so I think I live here physically while I’m often there mentally. And even if it's not there as a physical place, it's there as an experience. So ... all the years I lived in Rwanda, that’s what ... made me who I am. I came here as a student, in conditions ... in good conditions, compared to everything I went through there. Being here has allowed me to go back…, well, it gave me the time to think about what I had experienced in Rwanda. In recent years…, actually, all the years that I’ve spent in Canada have been years of reflection. I don’t know if I’m really integrating in the culture here [laughs] or if I'm inside my shell. At the same time, I’m starting to have a social network in this country—I have friends in Trois-Rivières, people from my cohort in graduate school, people from my summer work, people from the place where I teach French in the summer, so I meet a lot of people, and I embrace ... I more or less embrace the culture here, Western culture. I also think that having shared my experience on different occasions ... I think that has also allowed me to ... to adapt, in a way, to adapt by accepting … who I am. Although I should not remain in this role of a witness, because it’s a vulnerable position, but I ... being here as a student … has also been a kind of a stepping stone for me.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, I was wondering—when you arrived, the community was there to support you—was it more the Canadian community in Trois-Rivières that helped you integrate? Or were there Rwandans? Or both at the same time?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"Both at the same time. Well, there was ... when I arrived, Emmanuel wasn’t really here, he put me in touch with Callixte. But it was mainly with a couple of friends from France, who were also foreigners in this country, that I built a very strong friendship, right from the first months of our studies in Canada, and these friends later came to Rwanda and I went to visit them in France. So, with them it was ... and with other Québécois friends who joined our group towards the end of the master's degree. It was ... it was much more the community ... So I think it's both, it's the Canadian community, well, the Western community, but also a large part of the Rwandan community. Actually, there wasn’t a Rwandan community in Trois-Rivières, but I was in contact with Page-Rwanda, although not regularly. And then I met Josée, Josée Gicali, who had known my paternal grandparents whom I didn’t know, and it…, it helped create a very strong bond between us. So she also helped me integrate in the first months, and later I expanded my horizons elsewhere.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"Listening to you reveals that you’ve found friends in both communities, the Canadian and the Rwandan one. How would you compare the conversations you have with Canadians, well, with Montrealers, Quebeckers, Ontarians and when you find yourself in a conversation with Rwandans?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"I think…, well, I’ve never compared them, it's a bit of a difficult question, but I think it's different. Most of the Rwandans I meet here are survivors so ... obviously [?] ... [laughs] we speak ... our language. I remember the first time I was in Quebec City before meeting other Rwandans, it was ... it was wonderful to see ... I was at this place where they were performing dances from different cultures—it amazed me to see my culture in Quebec. Most often, when Rwandans get together ... we talk as if we’re still in Rwanda ... we also talk about our experiences during the genocide, we talk about everything, actually. ... In the company of Canadians, we talk about a bit of everything as well and we share our experiences too, but our experiences are very different. So, they’ll talk to me about vacations and I'll talk to them about Rwanda. Maybe I will slip in a few words about my experience ... During my first months in Canada, that’s all I was talking about and I felt overwhelmed, so today I don’t talk about it much. But at the time, I spoke about it often even to Canadians and to my French friends so it wasn’t ... But they are removed from my experience, so the conversation takes on another shape and there is a very big gap between what they tell me and what I tell them. Still, they were listening, they were very ... they didn’t rush or pressure me, well, I have been pressured, but not ... not on the part of these friends.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,What would you like Canadians to know about you?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"I don’t know [laughs]. ... It's a question of mutual acceptance. Sometimes we can be suspicious, thinking that Canadians haven’t lived through such major events, but ... they also have things to share ... I think it's a question of ... opening up to the experience of others. But it shouldn’t go in one direction only: just because we’ve had a painful experience doesn’t mean that we should not listen in return. I think that the history of Canada also contains some traumatic events and I think that sometimes we must accept to open ourselves to positive experiences. And especially when we’re talking about a genocide, I think, it's an issue, a phenomenon that is of concern to everyone. So during those conversations, it's not only about listening or accepting my experience, but it's much more about using this experience in relation to others, since, I think, genocides continue to happen, but they don’t happen twice in the same place. They always happen to other people, other places. So, I think that not only Canadians, but everyone has to become aware of our experience. That’s the greater usefulness of witness accounts— if possible, to protect others in other places.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"[laughs] ... I don’t know. It's a difficult question ... I don’t know since ... I think that all Rwandans, well, every Rwandan has his or her own experience and I’m not sure that I should be asking them to think about me in a certain way. Perhaps I should be asking how we should all consider each other. I think everyone lives their experience in their own way, and we should maybe try to listen to each other and abstain from judging each other. What upsets me the most, I think, is to be judged: “Oh, you’ll become mayibobo.” The perception that others have of you can really weaken you and you might think, “Oh, maybe ... I really am like that.” We live in a society and, unfortunately, one downside that I ... that I’ve noticed often about our community is that we’re always looking on a surface level and ... not everyone is like that, but in general it seems that we’re focusing on what is wrong with the other person. So, in this case [inaudible] we need to always make the effort to bring out those qualities in others that can help them advance, not the ones that can knock them down. I've been knocked down to the ground enough times that I don’t see the point of, for example, sitting around and, you know, criticizing others: “You know what? Oh, now [inaudible] is constantly drinking. But why do they drink? It's ... [inaudible] of orphaned children, it's a catastrophe! All they do is make babies and do drugs.

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, but what I did find out, although I don’t know if it's true, is that one of the killers died in Congo. A gentleman came to see me after the genocide to ask me to testify against someone who had been imprisoned and who had taken part in the killing. But when he came to see me…, well, I wasn’t there when my parents died, so it was difficult for me to testify against whomever ... I didn’t know that person, I had never seen him. But for the moment, we are looking for the bodies of my twin sisters who died in Bisesero. We haven’t found the place yet, but we’re looking.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, and for the time being, I don’t think I want to, anyway, at this point in my life, I don’t think I want to meet them. I know that my brothers sometimes go back there. And when I go back to Gisenyi I ... can’t bring myself to ... I went once where we…—actually twice, once to see if there were any photos left and a second time with my friends from France to show them the place. But we didn’t ... I didn’t stay long. I saw the neighbours who are still there, but I’m not really interested in ... staying in contact with them.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"Related to this, I know that there is also the Gacaca court where the survivors try to face and confront those who have killed their families and that’s where some people learn who the killers are. What are your thoughts on that?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yeah, I don’t want to meet them, so I don’t know if I would have the strength to go to the Gacaca, but one of my brothers has gone. The people from the neighbourhood where we used to live were denying that we had lived there and were saying that they didn’t know our parents, so my brother had to go there. And while he was there words were exchanged that didn’t really make sense. The neighbours were saying, “Oh yes, that’s right, you are the son of [inaudible]. Oh, I wasn’t here during the genocide, I was ...”—I don’t know where they said they were. And so they started admitting that our parents really lived there, that we lived there. But they were also saying that everyone had moved away by the time my parents died. It's a difficult subject. I think that the survivors would like to know more about certain aspects of what happened—for example, where the bodies are. But I don’t think that it really…, I don’t know if it has a healing effect. Someone who’s actually been at the Gacaca … will be able to say more about it, I think. Since I’ve never taken part in the Gacaca, I can’t say ...",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,That’s not something that appeals to you personally?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC BERTHE KAYITESI-LS-English Translation.docx,"It concerns me personally and collectively speaking, so ... if I try to understand the politics behind it... I don’t really understand it ... I can’t find the words, but ... personally, I'm opposed to forgiveness, I’m opposed to reconciliation. That doesn’t mean that my heart is filled with hatred and that I want the killers to be killed, no. But I think I prefer ... to live with whomever I want to live, whether they are Hutu or Tutsi, but that it is me who decides. So if we choose to live with each other, we know we'll have to deal with those questions and that’s a personal choice. But I can’t see myself meeting someone who has killed my father, who has cut him with a machete, and who says to me, “I cut him with the machete, forgive me.” So, I think ... I think, I won’t be going any further with ... the Gacaca. I see it as a policy that perhaps restricts choice. If I had to give a choice—the people who held the machetes and who were killing for months and months should be relocated and live elsewhere. I think that the survivors of the Rwandan genocide are a sacrificed generation, they see their killers day after day. I think it's like ... inadvertently, this might be reinforcing their denial. With a crime like that ... justice has to be done first and I don’t know if the Gacaca bring real justice.

I think that every survivor’s story must be heard in the singularity of experience that it recounts, so I can’t come forward as an example or a model. Or if I am to be such an example, it is up to the young person to request it—it shouldn’t come from me. I think that's the way to do it. But, more important to me is the message to [inaudible] the survivor’s circle of people. It's ... to really listen intently, to try to understand. The experiences we've been through ... can change our outlook on life, can change our ways of ... our behaviour.

For example, some villagers did some paid work [around our house]. Because of that, there was a lot of coming and going in the house, but also because we had many friends among our neighbours. My father was fond of the children who were going to school, so if a child didn’t want to go to school, the parents would come to see my father and ask him to talk to the child about it. And my father would promise to talk to the child, and thanks to this good parent many people in my neighbourhood went to school and he even paid the school fees for them.

You absolutely had to go to school and be among the best. The walk to and from the school was very tiring. There were good teachers from grade one to grade six and they were of all ages. All the students were treated the same way, no child was told that he was this or that. We simply felt like students and we felt like ourselves, the way you are Monique and I am myself. However, during certain classes, they would ask who among us were Tutsi and those students had to stand up, who were Hutu and they had to stand up, who were Twa and they had to stand up. There were two Twa students. We felt embarrassed and inferior when they were asking the Tutsis to stand up and we were only three or four people standing, but when it was Hutus’ turn, everyone stood up.

There was no way of not knowing, because on our way to school we would pass—we would see Twa and we thought they were funny. So we knew that there were the ethnic groups of the Twas, the Hutus and the Tutsis. That’s how I knew, I think, but I became more aware of it in the classroom, when I developed an inferiority complex when I had to stand up and when I saw that the Twa student was even more embarrassed than I was to be the only one standing while the others were making faces at him.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"It was difficult, but it was a problem we both had to solve. Often, while we were at work, we would catch ourselves wondering how the children were doing, especially since there were no phones at the time to call and ask. At the end of the day, we would very quickly wrap up and go home and if we were lucky the children would be there and doing fine. But at other times, we would find one of them with a fever, and for me that was difficult. All the time I had, I dedicated to them, and I imposed certain principles on myself. For example, I didn’t make any plans right after work, I went home first and made sure that the children had come home from school, that they had eaten and that they were doing fine. It was much more difficult to juggle work and raising children when they were too young to go to kindergarten, especially since we couldn’t be completely sure that the people who were looking after them were treating them exactly as we wished, but we were reassuring each other. At that time, we didn’t yet notice the wickedness in people; people hadn’t yet lost their humanity.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"Raising children in the city is very different from raising children in the village. In the village, each child has tasks to do and he knows what he has to do even if he shares his tasks with others. But in the city, the kids didn’t have tasks, but had, rather, people doing things for them. So it was only after, when they were grown, that we wanted to teach them how to do some of the housework chores, and it was difficult. For example, we asked the boys to wash their own clothes, but they would damage them. And that’s what was different between us, who had grown up in the village, because we knew that no one else was going to do it for us. Everyone took responsibility for their own things, including washing their clothes, but that’s not the case with kids who have grown up in the city, because they knew they had people doing things for them. So, integrating them in the housework was a problem at first, but little by little, it worked. They weren’t given many tasks. Their job was to study, and people did the rest for them, and it was like this until high school when the older boys started washing their clothes on Saturdays and Sundays, but they didn’t do this for too long because we left Rwanda to come here. I think the girls were even younger. They didn’t have any household chores to do, but sometimes we reminded them to make their beds, for example. They would agree to do it, but they knew that there would be someone else who would finish the work for them. So, in terms of housework, it was very different.",Interviewee,Tension

But most importantly, what was the main reason for this dismissal?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"It’s the same problem of Hutus and Tutsis. In 1973, they decided to expel Tutsi children from schools. I remember very well how it all started in my high school. It happened one morning and we were scared. We saw one of the teachers, her name was Victoria Nsaza—Nsanzubuhoro. She was an older mother and she saw that we were curious. We were three students in ninth grade, I think, and we were standing [outside the school] and talking. One was telling us that she had heard that in Saint-André they had started cutting people with machetes and the students had been expelled. The other one was telling us that it had started nearby, at the Medical Assistants school. We then went up the stairs towards the classroom. We saw three students, boys, standing outside the front door of the school. We thought they were going to attack us, so we started running and I went home to Shyorongi. What happened after that at the school, I don’t know, I had already left. I arrived home before Dad and when he came home, he asked me what had happened. I told him the whole story and he started to worry about the others [Jeanne d’Arc’s brothers and sisters] as well. One was studying at the Butare Groupe Scolaire, another one was studying in Rwamagana. He said he had learned that the same thing had happened the day before in Rwamagana and he wondered why they hadn’t come home yet. He feared they’d been killed. I only went back [to the school] much later to get my things. When we got there, we were prevented from entering and we were told that all the students who had gone home had to wait to be called for a meeting and that we could all go back to school at the same time. In fact, no one, even among the other students, knew what had really happened at the school. It appears that there were people who wanted to attack the school and that the nuns knew that beforehand and they told the students to go home. Nothing happened to anyone, unless something else was going on during the night.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"After a while. It was a long time before the schools opened again. When my high school reopened, they only accepted a few people per class. In fact, they didn’t take back the same number of Tutsis, some Tutsis had to start the application process all over again, so some went to other schools.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,I suppose there were others who didn’t even want to go back to school?,Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,So their studies ended there. I want to go back now to what you told me: that you and your little sister are the only survivors [in your family]. I wanted to ask if you could tell us what happened to the others.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"They were killed during the genocide of the Tutsis in 1994. They died, my father too. My father was killed in his home in Nyamweru, in the Shyorongi sector. They killed him along with his eldest daughter, who had come a few days before because she lived in Gitarama. As for my mother, she had passed away eight months prior. She didn’t die during the genocide. My brothers died while they were en route. In fact, a large majority of the family perished in the area between Nyanza and Butare. They were all put in a septic tank in the house of the Nyanza nuns, because one of our aunts who was a nun lived there. My brother, his wife, their children, and the wife of my other brother—he had died previously—with her five children, had all fled to her [the nun’s] home. We were also going there, but we were lucky that we couldn’t find a way to get to her house, otherwise we would be with them in that hole. So my brother, my two sisters-in-law and eight children lost their lives there. As for our house, those who lost their lives there were my father and my older sister—whose children were lucky to survive—and many other people who were at home. My little sister and I, we took the same road to find refuge, but we didn’t hide in the same place and it was only after the genocide that I found out she was still alive. I was in Bugesera when a soldier told me that she was working in the hospital and that she had given birth, because she was pregnant during the genocide. I asked the soldier if he could call her so that I could make sure that it really was her, because neither of us knew we were both alive. That’s how we found each other, and she now lives in Kigali.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,She was with her husband?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, she was with her husband. At the time, her husband was a student in Butare, they didn’t go through these difficult times together. My sister lived in Kigali, she was a nurse, and her husband was studying in Butare. They were able to reunite after they were lucky enough to survive.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"From what we have heard, the bodies of many of the people who died during the genocide were never found and they could not be buried. Were you able to find the bodies of your relatives and to bury them?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"There are two that we haven’t been able to find: François Kambanda and his wife, Odette Kamanzi. We couldn’t find them, but they died in the area between Nyanza and Butare. We looked for them everywhere. I thought that they must be in the memorial sites somewhere, because people were brought to these sites from wherever they happened to be killed and were placed in funerary monuments so they could be buried in peace. So I think they must be there too, as they are the only ones whose place of death we weren’t able to find.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,And you buried the others?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"They were picked up on the hills. In 1995, someone showed us where my father, my older sister and our neighbours were killed. We buried them at the house where we were born. And more recently, on July 12, 2009, we exhumed their bodies and brought them to the Gisozi Memorial Site, at the place for remembrance where the bodies of all the others are. The other members of the family, those who were with my aunt, Mother Augustine [the nun] and the head of this religious establishment and their families, were in a mass grave in Nyanza, but they were then placed elsewhere. The nuns were brought to Save and the other members of the family were brought to the Nyanza Memorial Site. I couldn’t be there for the transfer of the remains of the other family members to Nyanza, because I was here and I didn’t find out about it in time. I only knew about the transfer of the remains of the nuns and I went to Save in 2004.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I wonder, when you go back to Shyorongi, where you were born, or to Nyanza, where your relatives were killed, when you meet your old neighbours or maybe the people that you know have killed your family, what is your reaction? Do you talk to them? Do they avoid you?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"They don’t avoid me. They come to greet me as if nothing has happened. I was looking at them and was wondering what was the purpose of all this for them. I said to one person that they all used to live in peace in this region and that they’ve killed all the others and that I find that it didn’t serve them any purpose—on the contrary, they didn’t seem to be doing well. He then began telling me that it wasn’t him who had killed them, but so and so had done it, but he was naming people that didn’t exist or that I couldn’t identify. So given all this, I don’t know what to say to them anymore; you can only look at them and you can’t find appropriate words. When you’re there, you feel completely confounded.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"Can you explain to us how a person continues to live after all this? Because so many people are gone, but you still have children and a husband. Where do you find the strength to continue, what do you say to the children, how do you raise them after having gone through all this?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I really don’t know how one manages to live. It is a miracle from God because after all this, you feel as if you are nothing, you have the impression that your life is for nothing. For me, I got strength from seeing my friends who had lost their children or husbands, and were all alone. It made me realize that I was luckier than them, because I have lost family members, but they had as well, in addition to their children. They are all alone, but when you look at them, they seem strong. These are the things that give you the strength to continue living. But that doesn’t prevent an enduring sense of crisis: every little thing reminds you that you no longer have brothers or sisters and that you are an orphan. Even though we are older now and being an orphan might be easier to bear, we also feel we need our parents. We might have had more luck, but it doesn’t mean that life isn’t difficult sometimes and that’s what we say in Kinyarwanda: one parent consoles the other. When you are sad, you think of the other person who has lost everything and you say to yourself that if the other can continue, how can you give up? As for the children, we always try to remind them of their cousins ​​by asking them, for example, “Do you remember Olive?” Olive was their cousin, she was a year and a half or two years older than my daughter, but they grew up together and they were friends. I often remind her of Olive, asking her if she has any idea how old Olive, Marie-Ange’s sister, would be now. I also remind them of Olive’s big brother. I see that they understand and they remain strong, but I can’t talk about it without crying because to me these are people we can’t forget. We can’t forget, we are saddened, but we just have to keep our faith in God and continue living.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"Actually, by asking you this question, what I mostly wanted to know was what do you say to a child who’s growing up without neither a grandfather nor a grandmother? Do you talk to your children about what happened to your grandparents, your parents and yourself? Or do you let them find out for themselves?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"You have to explain to them because these are not things to be silent about. I think it’s good to explain to them what happened, and how people were senselessly killed so that they grow up knowing what a genocide is, and what caused it, so they don’t minimize its impact and so that they too can explain it to others. You can also direct them to documentation centres where they can find a lot of information to read, and you can ask them to do research on the topic so that the genocide doesn’t happen again because everyone would know what it is and everyone would help to fight against it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"You told us that already in 1973 you had heard about schools being attacked, and that you were afraid. In 1994, before the genocide began, were there any warning signs? Looking back, when do you think it actually started? And how did it degenerate to the point of becoming a genocide?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"There is something that my mother told me when political parties such as the LP [Liberal Party] and the RDM [Republican Democratic Movement] were created in Kigali, and many people were going into politics, she told us, “My children, you’ll see what the parties are going to lead to, they’re going to kill people.” She told us about what had happened long time ago with the creation of political parties such as Runari [Unar], Raderi [Rader] and others like them. She told us that it was these parties that provoked the war, and that’s how she knew that the creation of parties leads to war. She was telling us all of this as lived history. So, what I mean is that these were the early warning signs such as the creation of political parties like the Interahamwe and the conflicts between opposition parties. It was also rumoured that in some places, people were throwing rocks at the houses every night for no reason, people were killing each other, the Interahamwe were killing people, people attacked Gikondo and it was at that time that Katumba died. All this gave us an idea of ​​what was to come, it was clear that these killings would not be limited to Gikondo or other places, that they would spread everywhere.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I believe that everyone who survived the genocide did so because there was someone who had helped them hide. Some wanted to hide people and others didn’t. There are also those who could do it and those who couldn’t. It depended on the status of the person: if it was an influential individual, he could hide people in his home and no one was going to attack him at home, if no one knew they were hiding people there, of course, it had to be done in secret. Very few people were able to do that. If everyone had a good heart, and each person had hidden ten Tutsis, whole families wouldn’t have been extinguished. It didn’t happen because there was little will.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"It didn’t take us any time to decide. After surviving the genocide, there were many reasons that led us to make this decision. People were saying that the same thing can happen again while we live in the country with our children. Our main motivation was to find a better place to educate our children and to live in safety. Had some relatives from our extended family been outside of the country during the genocide, there would have been more survivors in our family. Maybe we would still have a brother for whom people would say that he is the descendant of Kambanda. This is not possible now.",Interviewee,No Tension

Integration takes many years before you start feeling that you are where you are supposed to be, even though sometimes you don’t feel that you have fully integrated. And you force yourself because you know you can’t go back. In spite of the difficult things that you’ve lived through in Rwanda, when you arrive here, you realize that you don’t know how you’re going to manage and sometimes you think you won’t be able to do it.

Otherwise, to me it seemed that we were received warmly in the country.

At that time, our children were not yet at the university level. I didn’t go back to school for at least another five years, but I was working during that time. I was able to integrate easily with the help of the people from the community with whom I was in touch. They referred me to a place where I could do a caregiver training, but I didn’t stay there long. Otherwise, I was at home for most of the time, doing housework and waiting for the kids to come home from school. I went back to study social work for two years. After graduating, I found a job and I’m still working in this field.

I personally asked one of them—I had heard that he had been imprisoned and then freed—and he told me that he was given a short sentence of 13 years only, and he had done his time. When listening to his answer, you realize that he himself is aware that his sentence doesn’t match his crime. That’s what I’m referring to when I talk about the wound that still hurts.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I was thinking, precisely, that at least those who committed the genocide think that they have been forgiven, but what is the benefit of the gacaca for the survivors?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I never had the opportunity to go, but I know people who have gone and who came back rather depressed. It’s depressing, especially because they tell you about the death of your parent, saying, for example, that he was struck by so and so with a hammer or a knife, and that’s what they talk about at the gacaca, and whoever goes there and hears about the death of their relatives, comes back sick. I think hearing this hurts even more and it’s better not to hear anything. Normally, criminals are punished. I think that what can help us is to find people to talk to about it on a regular basis so that you don’t always keep it in your heart and don’t remain sad, even if the sadness will never completely go away, but it’s still worth talking with those who have also had the experience or those who are interested in hearing about it. Through discussions, the genocide remains an important topic, and I think that’s all we can do for our departed ones, and nothing else.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"We can wish them to remain courageous, not to give in to weakness caused by the death of their loved ones and by other things in life. You must remain strong so that those who have caused you harm don’t rejoice at the sight of you going mad. Also try to talk a lot with others so you don’t have to be alone, because it’s better to talk than thinking about it alone.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I think we talked about almost everything, even though we didn’t have time to expand on some topics. The message I would like to send is to say that it is good to discuss this together so that we always remember—because we couldn’t write a book. It would be good if you could talk with everyone else so that we continue talking about our genocide, because it’s us and no one else who will keep the topic open.

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"I would explain to them the genocide and what happened to us, because most of them ask us anyways about what caused it. So we have to take the time to explain who the genocide perpetrators are so that Canadians are not left with the impression that all Rwandans were perpetrators. They might meet a person from the other group and after hearing their perspective Canadians might think that the genocide perpetrators were the Tutsis. So we have to find the time to explain the causes of the genocide, its inception and who were the people who were killed.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE JEANNE D%27ARC MUKANDAHIRO-LS-English translation.docx,"That’s a difficult question… What can I say… I’m just a survivor of the genocide and that’s all. What I can add to the previous question is to ask that we continue to teach about the genocide in schools so that the young children grow up knowing what it is, so that it isn’t something that only adults know about and that only this generation will remember, but on the contrary: that it is known from one generation to the next.",Interviewee,No Tension

I don’t know in what order to answer the question… My family situation: I have five children and the two that you see here are my nephew and my niece who arrived on October 1 of last year. Two of the children are here and the little girl, Larissa, she’s Blandine’s little sister—you see Blandine here—Larissa is at school right now, so she couldn’t be here. My sense of belonging to the Rwandan community: of course, I don’t know if I have a place in this community, due to many reasons. I’ve participated a lot in many activities and I still participate. I’m a member of the Humura Association. I’ve been a member of all the Rwandan community associations in this country, in all the places I’ve lived. I used to live in Quebec City and then I came here, to Ottawa, in the Outaouais region, but also—I’ve lived elsewhere in Ontario because of work.

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I was born in a small town in the Butare prefecture. I was born on a hill called Nkima, very close to Mount Huye. My father worked in the Butare parish for many years. In fact, he had to quit school—he was taken out of school when he was very young because during that time, it was still colonial times, those who showed, say, promising abilities in primary school didn’t have the chance to continue their education. They were immediately “taken,” or “recruited” so to speak, by the Belgian authorities and put to work, despite the fact that the goal of being in school is to finish school, at least primary and then secondary school. Witnesses, in particular my former teacher Nayigiziki, have told me that my father was a very intelligent man, and that was a problem. So he started working in the Butare parish at a very young age. He was someone very, very honest, with strong principles, and I appreciated that. My mother was also a very strong woman, but I must admit that my grandmother had a great influence on me. My grandmother was the midwife in the village and I think that over 99 percent of the people born within a 20-kilometer radius from there were “her children.” Everyone called her Grandma.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,Oh yes?!,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"And she was a strong woman, principled too, who taught me many things because, as you know, in the Rwandan tradition, being the youngest in the family—and since my grandfather had died in the 1940s—my father sent me to live with Grandma. She used to call me her little husband!",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, yes.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"You know how we say that in our culture. She influenced me a lot. She was the one that transmitted to me all the knowledge, all I needed to know about my family because I didn’t have the chance to meet my grandfather, it was she who talked to me about him. And my grandmother’s strength, it—I especially appreciated it in the difficult years 1959–1960, yes, because I remember, for example, that when they were burning the houses, when they were destroying our households, everyone was fleeing to Ngoma, in the parish there, but grandmother, she sat in front of her pen and she was saying: “Ndashaka kureba umwana w'imbwa uza kuntwikira inzu kandi arinjye wamubyaje.”",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,Yes.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"In French it means: “I’d like to see the little rascal who dares set my house on fire while it was me who delivered him at birth.” And she stayed there. And the people who were attacking the houses, when they saw her, they didn’t dare come near her house. But they were cowards and took advantage of the darkness of the night to burn her house, while she was inside. Fortunately, she had foreseen this and she had gone elsewhere, to sleep in someone else's house that night. I have great memories, great memories of my family… I don’t know if I want to talk about my brothers and sisters just yet…",Interviewee,Tension

All of them, because in the family, of course, it is the eldest in the family who bears the burden because he’s the one who should lead the troops, so to speak. My father—he grew up with the missionaries, because he worked for them and he had this goal—he wanted at least one of the brothers to be a clergy—a religious sister and a priest. We had a brother who was clergy, we had a—",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,What was his name?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"His name was Brother Canisius Nduwumwe. He led choirs in several places, he studied in Nyamasheke, he led the Inkeramihigo choir, they sang many well-known songs. And he won choral competitions. And we also had a—not really my sister, but a cousin, my uncle's daughter, whose name was Sister Françoise Mukamparirwa and who was also killed during the genocide in Nyanza. She was intendant at the Christ-Roi secondary school, and, oddly enough, the person who had ordered this crime was a former classmate of mine, Father Hormisdas Nsengimana. I remember that in our school dormitory, his bed was—in Kansi, at Kansi’s Petit Séminaire—his bed was next to mine. And it was him who ordered the killing of my—of Sister Françoise, my cousin, and also of our former catechesis teacher, Father Mathieu Ngirumpatse, so, that’s to say… So I was supposed to be a priest because I studied at the seminary. It didn’t pan out, but I don’t regret it at all. My older brother Vincent—he’s the father of these two kids here—I have to say something about Vincent, because in the family, in any family, we can be brothers and sisters, but there is always this one person who is our hero. For me that was him… [big sigh]  It was him, we had a special connection, unique, and… [sigh] In 1973, when things started, when, I think, the second wave of refugees, or the third, or the fourth—we left together because we were kicked out of school at the same time; he was also in high school.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,Yes. I was at the Petit Séminaire—,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"At the Petit Séminaire, yes.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"—in Kansi. And then, when we, the young seminarians, arrived in Bujumbura, our former rector, Father Joseph Nyirumugabo, had already arrived there before us. As soon as he reached Bujumbura, he made sure that all those who came from the Petit Séminaire in Rwanda could find a place in the Kanyosha Petit Séminaire in Bujumbura. I got a place in the school without a problem, but Vincent wasn’t so lucky. What happened eventually was that in July, after Habyarimana’s coup d'état, and since Vincent was not doing anything in Bujumbura and his classmates were going back to school, he decided to return to Rwanda, unfortunately, and that’s what happened. My big sister, the only daughter in the family, Godelieve, her story is extremely sad, because she married a Congolese, a Zairian at the time, who was working in a biochemistry lab at Lubumbashi University, and so she moved to Lubumbashi. She lived there with her husband, she had two children, and since there were a lot of—she spent a long time there without paying a visit to the family. In 1996—no, 1986–87, I think—she asked her husband's permission to travel to our family house so that our relatives could meet her children, and the husband gave her permission. She came with the two children, her son and daughter Eric and Catherine, and she was pregnant too. On her way there, she passed through Bujumbura and I accompanied her to the border because I couldn’t cross the border. She then continued on her way. A year later I went to work in southern Africa, in Swaziland. So, while she was home, she had—she found a job with a Canadian NGO and she talked to her husband about it, and her husband said, “Listen, given the economic situation in Zaire, the chaos that reigns here, it might be better that you stay working there, if you are earning better money than here, you can help us too.” She had her baby, Rodrigue, there; the two older ones, Eric and Catherine, started primary and then secondary school. The genocide caught up with them there and that’s what’s striking: Godelieve was killed, the two children, Eric and Catherine, were also killed in the secondary schools where they were, in their boarding school, and, imagine, the one who survived the genocide is precisely the child she was carrying when she came to vising home. That boy, whose name is Rodrigue, is now a student at the Butare University. He’s a good boy, but he doesn’t know his father, and his father doesn’t know him either.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,His father is still alive?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I don’t even know, I don’t know. I had the opportunity to meet some people from Congo when I was working in Switzerland, near Geneva, I met some people from Congo and I asked them—because some of them were from Lubumbashi—to tell him what was left of his family, that he [Rodrigue] existed. I didn’t hear back from these people, but he managed to trace some of his paternal relatives on Facebook. Basically that's what I can say about my immediate family. Unfortunately, of all the adults, I’m the only survivor and I had the chance to bring here those who were also alive, that is, Jean-Blanchard, Blandine and Raïssa [or Larissa? – translator’s note].",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"We’ll come back to the genocide, but before that, I have some additional, more general, information… So, you mentioned the—that you went to the Petit Séminaire in Rwanda.  I would like to know—well, you mentioned that you had a good relationship with the one who killed—",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"—my cousin, yes, yes—",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"—your cousin, but with—so, you had a good relationship—as a student, you maintained good relationships with your fellow students. Was there anything in particular that could be seen as a remnant from the events of 1960 or was it, rather, that students as well as teachers lived in harmony? What do you remember from that time?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"At the Petit Séminaire it wasn’t—it wasn’t really—especially in Kansi, these were, I would say, the best moments of my youth, particularly because of the teachers we had. I had the good fortune to know people who were, I would say, exceptional, like Bishop Alexis Kagame, he was the director of our Petit Séminaire, and Father Boniface Musoni, Father Joseph Niyomugabo who later served as Rector. At the Petit Séminaire in Kansi, it was complete harmony, complete harmony. But, I think something was brewing because of certain individuals. But it wasn’t out in the open, it wasn’t out in the open until 1994. During the first grades of the seminary, in Save, yes, there were vestiges there of the 1960s, mostly conveyed by—you know the Diocese of Butare included part of Gitarama, a large part of Gikongoro, if not all of Gikongoro, and Butare.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,That’s right.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"And the boys who came from Gikongoro were particularly vicious. You could already see it, during the teenage years, their early teenage years, until they were 17–18 years old, it was by then very, very visible. I remember, for example, a basketball game when Father Martin Kabalira had it in for our classmate. It wasn’t just an altercation, we could see that he [the Father or the student? – translator’s note] was being mean about it and that was surprising, given the setting where we were, at the Petit Séminaire in Save. But besides this incident, it was more insidious than that because, as you know, there was, in the lower primary grades in Save, a tradition that was not at all a good thing and that consisted of, basically, hazing the new students at the Petit Séminaire from, say, seventh grade preparatory, which was in Cyahinda. The new students who came from sixth grade in the Latin section were the favourite targets for the students in fifth grade in the Latin section—",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, yes.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"But those who were in fifth grade Latin also protected the kids who came from the same parish as us. But we were realizing more and more, especially in the years between 1970 and 1972, that this protection was happening along other lines, you see, and the other children who were in fifth grade were questioned if they knew of any Tutsi children who would also be coming to the school. And, we believed it was our duty to protect them. Because the hazing, it had taken a rather ethnic turn—",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"No. No such tendencies. In the upper school years, when things started—especially at the beginning of the crisis, 1973, you could already feel it because of what happened in Burundi and the Burundian students who were there were particularly…—and we can understand why. They really were [vague] [vague], they didn’t accept at all the harmony that prevailed there. But they had to. I remember that when the students from the other schools were chased all over the country, Father Joseph Nyirumugabo, during what was called “spiritual reading,” told us: “Know that here you are all brothers. There is no way that students of one ethnic group would hunt down students from the other ethnicity [vague]. If that ever happens, we will close down the school.” I also remember something very, very important, namely, that the dean of the school at the time was called Thaddeus. Thaddeus Rusingizandekwe was from Kibeho, he was a priest. So the adjacent schools, like the Butare Groupe Scolaire, learned that in Kansi we were rebels and we didn’t want to chase the Tutsis away. They sent a commando. Yes! A commando that was led by a certain Jean—Jean… what was it—his family name is well-known—it’ll come to me. He was the leader of other commandos. We knew each other well because at that time I was captain of the volleyball team, which by the way is still going, I think it’s still the best volleyball team at the high school level.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"The Butare team was called Dynamo and I was the captain at the time, so he knew me. When this commando arrived, they—they went into the schools, it was around 2 o’clock, and strangely, we noticed that the teachers weren’t there, while the school had to start, the class had to start. They were already gone. And then we saw two or three vans filled with students carrying knives, machetes and so on. And then they went into the classrooms and said that all the Tutsis had to go out. The other students, my classmates said, “No, don’t go out.” The Hutus told us not to go out. We remained seated and I—my bench was at the back and then this Jean, came up to me with a knife and put it on my throat and said, “You too, Richard, you can’t—can you pretend you're not a Tutsi? Stand up.” I got up, but another student was telling me, “Sit down.” But listen, the first guy had a knife. So I went out and the whole class was out as well.",Interviewee,Tension

But the incendiary speeches of President Kayibanda, for example, were very well received by the Hutu population of the hills, the vast majority of them, not everyone but the vast majority, liked what they were hearing.

It wasn’t at all—we weren’t at all at ease during certain times of the year when things happened, like the inyenzi’s arrival in the Nshili, or something like that. And if there was a social or an economic crisis and if President Kayibanda said something on the radio—that was enough for people to start sharpening their machetes.

[a long silence] So the distance between our house and Butare is only five kilometers and I walked from Butare to our house on the hill, and back again. And they followed me, but without saying a word. The only person I talked to was an old man named Joseph Gatabazi, and when I spoke to him he said, “Richard, we ate the beast with seven—with eight teats…” I didn’t understand what he meant: “We ate the beast with eight teats”—“igikoko cy'amabere umunani.” It was his way of telling me that they had eaten the inedible, meaning their dog.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, yes, yes. But I find this debate completely meaningless, meaningless because a survivor is anyone who, had they been present at the time, they would have been killed. I’ll give you the example of my nephew Rodrigue: in our patrilineal society, he’s not even a Rwandan. His father is Congolese, his big sister and his big brother, who came with their mother, my sister, were killed in high school, in the boarding schools where they were—who can stand before of me and tell me that Rodrigue is not a survivor? Can anyone tell me that? But according to the other logic, he’s not even Rwandan because his father is Congolese.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,You’re right.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Right? His big sister was killed, his mother was killed, his big brother was killed, and someone would come and tell me that Rodrigue is not a survivor because he is not Rwandan? That he’s not Tutsi, that he’s not even Hutu—it’s completely absurd. Second, I think that people sometimes suffer from—quite often, in fact—certain egocentrism that tends to exclude, to put other people outside the definition of survivors. And we define who is a survivor according to our own egocentrism. That’s not normal, it’s even “insane,” as they say in English. It’s unhealthy, it’s unhealthy and it’s surprising that someone whose whole family is alive, intact, and despite all the trauma that they’ve been through, the father, the mother, the seven brothers, the three sisters, everyone is still there and this person thinks he has the right to judge others whether they are not survivors because it didn’t happen while they were in Rwanda. I’m the only one remaining of the adults in my family, so some people are questioning whether I am a survivor. Listen, that’s completely crazy, these people must have some kind of problem [makes a sign with his hand], it’s crazy to try to exclude me or give me points that do or don’t qualify me as a survivor.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I can perhaps understand the narcissistic propensity that pushes people towards egocentrism and makes them define who is a survivor according to their own understanding, limiting the definition to what suits them, but excluding others.

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"So you talked about your life at the college, in high school, on the hills. You’ve met some people who behaved like human beings and others who were more ill-natured, more mean-spirited. And after you arrived here, in Canada, you found a Rwandan community made up of—we continue calling it ethnicity even though these are not ethnic groups, but that’s a subject for another debate. But there are Hutus and there are Tutsis. What kind of relationships have you established? How do you feel about the relationships, the exchanges you have with the Tutsis? Can we say—has there been—could there be harmony between the Tutsis, harmony between the Hutus? Do Tutsis and Hutus manage to communicate in an authentic, deep and sincere way?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"It’s very difficult because, you know, the problem—an identity problem is very difficult to delineate. And I can’t say either that complete harmony reigns between the different groups, the different identities that we have, Hutus and Tutsis, etc. It’s not 100 percent harmony either. And in each identity group there are subgroups that are also created, unfortunately, according to completely new parameters. In fact, there are no ethnic groups in Rwanda, there are only Rwandans. Well, the relations between—within the community are friendly, the interpersonal relations, but when we refer to Hutus, Tutsis, it depends on who you are talking about. Some people are known to be very open to friendly relationships with everyone. And these people are not necessarily welcome in some communities, Hutus for example. Well, what can you do? We’re talking about reconciliation efforts, for example in Rwanda, we’re talking about efforts to bring together Hutus and Tutsis in the diaspora—there are some Hutus who don’t want that, right? There are probably also Tutsis who don’t want that. But the vast majority—well, I think it’s a question of education, but also of personal willingness to open up to the other.

This is what we’re missing and if such opportunities exist—and they do, for example, the people who go to church to pray, they sing together and pray to the good Lord, but what happens after the Mass?

Yes, well, listen, the ideal for me would be to grow old on the green hills of my dear country—that’s the ideal, yes.

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Listen, you just mentioned it: indeed, not a day goes by that we don’t think about the genocide, whether we are survivors, like you, or whether we are not necessarily survivors in the strictest sense of the term, but we are so by proxy, because when we say that a genocide is a crime against humanity, every sensible person feels that it’s a crime committed against the whole of human race. And there are two questions we often ask ourselves. You touched on the first one briefly—maybe you could go back to it… So the first question: How have human beings come to this, to do such things—the unimaginable, the unspeakable, the incomprehensible? And the second question is: What can people who have lived a tragedy like that, a genocide, do to get through this? What path do they take? Where does their strength come from?  Because often—you know, when researchers, journalists see someone who has experienced tragedies like the genocide, they often think about post-traumatic stress, and they often ask about that—or about depression—but we see people like you, like your nephews here, who don’t seem to be, quote-unquote, “kuba barahahamutse,” and we see many survivors who are strong—where does this force come from? What keeps people going, what gives them strength? So, maybe that's—what do you want to start with first?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"The first question you are asking—How do people come to commit unspeakable acts? Essentially, this is a question about good and evil. How can one choose evil, the absolute evil? In fact… [long silence] When genocide perpetrators are questioned—I’ve never heard a single one of them, not a single one say that he’s committed the genocidal act with joy—they always look for nonexistent pretexts. In fact, these are also strategies of surviving the evil that they’ve committed. But in the heat of the moment, in the heat of the moment, you have to equip yourself with tools that will allow you to carry out that action. One of the most common such tools is to justify precisely the unspeakable, it’s the demonization, the dehumanization of the victim. The very name by which the victims are called—inzoka, snake, cockroach, vermin, rat—sanctions an act believed to be legitimate or acceptable or justifiable because one wants to eradicate something considered dirty, bad, dangerous or not acceptable. So if one thinks they’re killing a snake, if one thinks they’re killing a rat, a cockroach, one thinks that what they’re doing is cleaning. That's why it’s called “work,” gukora, right? Gukora is a noble act, work that ennobles the individual; gukora, an acceptable act. It’s when the heat of the moment passes that one begins to ask the real questions and one looks for strategies of survival after what has been done. So how can someone like that survive and find their humanity? They must first accept, define, name their true actions with real terms. They are—they’ve committed the irreparable. In fact, when we talk about reconciliation, in general, it’s—the person, the individual should first come to reconciliation with himself, because before committing this act, one was a human being. During the act, when one commits the unspeakable, one is no longer a human being. How to return to this humanity? It’s not me who’ll give it back to him, it’s up to him to come to terms with—to reconcile the beast that he became and the human that he was before. It’s a personal effort. And after, one can say, “What I did is unimaginable, do I feel remorse? Do I want to repent? Am I ready to ask for forgiveness? And how can I make the victim understand? If what I say is truly authentic, how can the victim understand that my actions are sincere?” There are very few people, among the killers, who accept to take that step. Whereas the second question, I think it’s more related to—",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"To the victims! And here too, it is necessary that the victims reconcile first with their own selves, because they have been dehumanized, and so it is up to them to find again their humanity with the help of the existing services that can support them. Here, I think, the authorities, the government, or the authorities more broadly, can play an important role using the existing resources, but also the existing specialized services to which, unfortunately, not everyone has access.

But some people, in appearance, seem to be functioning normally. It's a decoy—it’s a decoy because everyone has been affected. How do people manage to give a semblance of normal life? That's another conversation, but what we need to know is that they’re bluffing. How long will this last? It depends on each person’s strength. Someone who breaks a leg or an arm and who doesn’t go to the doctor won’t always have a broken arm—the arm will heal awkwardly, and he will have to live with that. It’s exactly the same for survivors who are not provided services. You can’t say that what happened has been erased.

We have children, these children will have children—can we say that those children are survivors? Absolutely. That's precisely the message that should be sent to people who label others, isn’t it? Because if my son asks me, “How come I don’t have aunts, uncles, grandparents?”—what explanation do you want me to give to a child who was born in Canada? And what will be his explanation to his own children?

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"One thing is striking, and I would like you to share your point of view on this. Rwandans and Africans in general are believers.

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"It has changed in the fact that… I remain a believer with all the conviction in my faith that I have always had. I am still a believer. What has changed is my attitude towards the intermediaries between me and God, that's all. And I’m including everyone in this. I think I follow the precepts of what I’ve learned in my Catholic religion, but I’m also thinking: all the intermediaries between me and God, starting with the priest of the parish all the way up to the pope—I now choose my people. Just because you’re wearing a cassock doesn’t give you the authority to teach me how to live my faith. The best prayer for me—for anyone—are one’s actions, not memorizing the Bible or the— [inaudible] For me, it’s not that. Show me how you live in accordance with your faith, the rest is blah-blah.

ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"The first trigger was my Bishop, whom I’ve told you about. And I have many stories to tell about that—it’s not the first. I’ve seen things that are incredibly difficult to accept. And this coming from someone considered to be pastor of the people. I had the opportunity to meet him on a plane, with Bishop Rubwejanga. Rubwejanga saw me and he recognized me and said, “Hey! How is it going? It’s you—” And then he said, “Come to see Bishop Gahamanyi, say hello to him.” I said, “No way!” He said, “Why not?” “You know well why not, Bishop.” And he said, “I understand.” We were three friends before we left for Burundi: François Buseruka, Rubayiza Emmanuel and myself. Before we left for Burundi, we went to seek advice from Bishop Gahamanyi. We all met in Butare, we all went there, we went to his house. When we arrived at the entrance to his place, the concierge told us—we gave our names, we told him that we had come to see Bishop Gahamanyi, to ask him for advice before leaving the country. The concierge went—the Bishop had a two-story house—and we could see him on the second floor, reading the breviary. The concierge went to talk to him. I saw the Bishop going into the—then a few minutes later, the concierge came back downstairs and told us, “I’m sorry, he’s not here.” “He’s not?” “No.” “Where is he?” “I just learned that he’d left for Kigali this morning.” Okay. We weren’t surprised because we knew the kind of man he was. Then, after the concierge came down, we asked for some paper to write a letter. We wrote it together. I won’t go into the details of its contents, but it basically said that it was over between him and us, because we saw him in his house, we told him that we had seen him and that’s why all three of us had decided to no longer be priests.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Earlier you mentioned the importance of talking to your children who are also survivors—the fact that they don’t have grandparents, they don’t have aunts. Sometimes the kids are given homework from school: go ask your grandparents how they did things in their time, how they were celebrating or organizing weddings, baptisms, etc. Obviously, to these children’s parents, who are survivors, this always causes anguish. When you see your children, listening to these horror stories, would it—how should I formulate the question?—as a parent, one may be concerned: “Can the fact that my children know what happened to their parents affect them? Can that follow them throughout their lives? Can it hurt them? But on the other hand, one wonders: “Is it our duty to pass on to our children what we have lived through?”",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Well, I think we have the duty to our children to teach them where they come from. It is a past that’s hard to accept, but what can we do? We’re talking about the transfer between generations of what happened. If the theories that, for example in Jewish communities, second-generation survivors still feel the “effects of the genocide,” are true, then it must be true for our children too. Knowledge has to be passed on, it all depends on how you phrase things. Maybe you have to choose a good moment and little by little make them understand what happened. But it’s difficult to avoid creating, in the future, useless extremists. That’s the difficult thing: how to transmit a message that is pure, authentic, real and without creating unnecessary, dangerous extremism, because all extremists are dangerous. So how can we pass on this heritage so that they understand where they come from and in a way that, perhaps, gets them to fight the evil as soon as it begins to appear elsewhere or within others, and without necessarily venturing into extremism. All the while being aware, precisely, of where they come from and what had taken place. That’s what is most difficult. But it’s our duty.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"And I think that someone like you who does conflict resolution—it’s a mission, obviously, that we can understand well and we can commit to it and at the same time we realize how hard it is to make others understand this, including the people around us. Among the—this past—you were saying just now: “The country might be a country of horrors, but my wish is to grow old in my country.” So there is a very positive image you keep of this country, despite everything. Is this a way of reconciling with this country which is also a country of horrors?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I think I’m an individual who is part of a lineage. My great-grandparents, my grandparents and my parents made me who I am and they left us something tangible: the [estate?], so to speak. I've been there, everything they’ve left us there is intact, it’s wild with vegetation, but it’s intact. I think that growing old there would be a great challenge, to carry on the family line and to pass my testimony, so to speak, on to Jean-Blanchard and the other children.  It would be unfortunate if those who wanted to exterminate an entire nation would be able to say: this used to be the place of so-and-so, the same way we now point to Nyagakecuru’s property on the summit of Mount Huye—there are no children, he has no descendants. I am alive, I have to go back home one of these days, and I also think that’s what they are thinking [points to his nephews]. I would like to build a house there and grow old in it. But on the other hand, aging without being cut with a machete [laughs]—can that be guaranteed? But all in all, I think it was the best option, to continue this legacy so that it endures, yes.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"You have received a really beautiful legacy from your grandmother who gave life, who helped people be born, who was taking care of—she has passed on to you something very profound and that’s what you continue doing. It’s transmitting this life force, this energy of life to overcome conflicts, to be stronger, to continue living. Earlier, you briefly touched on the many different kinds of mourning, difficult to bear, since it was only last year that you finally learned how your parents had died. And without a doubt, I think mourning like that also connects us to many other bereavements because it’s not only our parents that we’ve lost, it’s also friends, it’s also neighbours, it’s also acquaintances, colleagues and also in some sense the bereavement of a country—a country that is not what we would like it to be. Are we going to get through this? Can a mourning like that… Usually, at a funeral, we perform the burial ceremony and then we have the impression that we have done what needed to be done and we can move on to other things. In the case of the genocide, is it something—is it a process that can be completed? Is it a—",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I don’t think we can complete this process, because the act of a genocide is written in letters of blood and fire that remain indelible and… We have the duty to remember, but when we think about memory we also have to think about everything that memory entails, if you see what I mean. Life must continue except that life does not continue as we think it would, that’s the problem. We live with it, but we make the decision to continue living and that’s why we’re called survivors. So, the mourning of an entire people [silence] is unfortunately now part of the identity of an entire people, on whichever side we are, we can’t escape that so easily. We can’t escape that so easily… If, for example, the genocide of—well, the Jewish people took place primarily in Germany or Poland, in Auschwitz, Treblinka [inaudible] and so on, it didn’t take place in Israel, but the duty to remember is everywhere, even in the United States, in Montreal, Canada. Overcoming this means finding in such barbaric, savage act, in the absolute evil, the tools with which to gather the strength that would allow people to go forward, and that’s possible. And that’s why to say that we can get through and erase [gestures “to erase” with the hand]—that's impossible. But, I think, it’s about refusing destruction in the name of moving forward. And of course the fire that can—the energies that can make us progress towards that future, it is precisely memory and all that it entails, so whether we like it or not, that’s what we have.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"I would like to end with two questions. In fact this whole process of—you have thought about it a lot and during our meeting last time, you did a—you initiated a questioning, an exchange on this topic. Unfortunately, time restrictions didn’t allow you to purse this further. And now, the intention of the people who will listen to your interview that you have agreed to make public—it could really help because you have made a first step in that direction. First, you made a distinction between forgiveness and reconciliation. So, I wish we could—that you could talk about your understanding, first of all, of reconciliation. Obviously, for people in Rwanda to be able to continue to live together and build this country, we say: “people need to reconcile.” And indeed, one wonders how can people live in that country after what happened without there being some reconciliation? So when I speak of reconciliation, there are, on the one hand, the current actions carried out by politicians, by priests over and above the population of the victims and also the genocide perpetrators; there are people whose objective is reconciliation. They have their way of doing things. I’d like to hear your thoughts about that first, your point of view on these different ways of approaching reconciliation, and if there really should be a reconciliation—how do you see that? We will talk about forgiveness after.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Well, for me, reconciliation necessarily involves all the actors: the victims as well as the perpetrators of evil. Each actor has a role to play. Meaning: those who have committed the crime must accept that they have done so and must be able to express all the evil they have caused, to name it in full and to assess its depth, its magnitude, and to be able to say that to the person who has suffered.  The individuals who have committed the crime must also—must be open to showing remorse, to demonstrate their impossibility to change the past, to assess rightly that what they have done is beyond repair and that they therefore humbly ask for forgiveness; that they express their repentance in front of the victim for what they have done. Before that, of course, as I was saying, reconciliation begins within one’s self. You have to recreate and revisit the person that you used to be, right? Before making that step, right? So first you have to recover your lost humanity because before dehumanizing the other, the victim, the perpetrator has dehumanized himself because that’s not what he used to be before. To make that step, to recognize the depth and magnitude of the harm that they have caused and to accept that, unfortunately, there are things beyond repair and that to continue living as a nation we must go forward. But irreparable doesn’t mean preventing people from living, but proposing ways and means, if only a minimum of reparation, even just symbolic, to show sincere repentance and recognition of the evil that has been done. On the victim’s side, too, life must continue and it must continue in a more or less normal fashion. To retreat in narcissistic pain is not a solution either. If the victim recognizes the repentance of the executioner as sincere, if the victim understands that the act of repentance is honest, if he understands that, indeed, no reparation is possible, but that nevertheless we must move forward, if he understands that accepting the executioner’s repentance can also make—it helps break open the abscess of resentment, the venom that he has been digesting from the moment the evil was done. I think that being open would help the victim in the process of healing. It would be good for the victim to open up and accept the repentance of the other, not to skip stages in the process, so to speak, but, at least, little by little, these are… It can’t be done in a day, it can’t happen in a year, it will take time, but we must let time do its work. That's why sometimes politicians push an agenda that can’t be pushed. It’s like a small wound, and this wound is internal. If you cut your finger at quarter past ten today, you can’t say, “Okay, at three o’clock I have to be healed.” These things are… Reconciliation requires both sides, absolutely. We can’t either—and this is important—it must be voluntary. Obviously, this also requires education and that, I think, is the great responsibility of our political leaders: to educate the people. But they too must be able to live up to this educational standard because, you see, just because one is a politician doesn’t mean that one is educated, about certain notions, at least. One has to have a good understanding of these things to get people to also understand them well. So, then—unlike forgiveness—forgiveness doesn’t require the presence of both parties even if reconciliation and forgiveness are linked. But forgiveness—I can forgive someone who isn’t present because forgiveness isn’t necessarily a gift given to the other; it’s a gift that one must first give to one’s self because it is in my own interest to break open this abscess and drain the pus that torments me and prevents me from living my life, right? So, I can forgive someone who isn’t present and I can forgive someone without telling them, that’s not their problem When I think to myself, “Starting today, I will erase this debt,” it’s my right to erase it. Okay. I don’t know anyone who says that “forgiving means freeing a person from a prison and then realizing that the prisoner was in fact one’s own self.” So I must forgive first for my own self before I do the same for someone else. We can forgive without reconciling if the person is not there, but we can’t be reconciled without both parties being present, that’s impossible. That’s why the survivors ask the same question: “Who do I have to reconcile with since no one showed up?” That’s it!",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"We saw, in particular, in Germany, after the Holocaust, that sometimes it was the children—seeing that their parents wouldn’t ask for forgiveness, it was the children themselves, the descendants of the executioners, who asked for forgiveness.  How do you see this kind of—does this approach make sense? What is the value of asking for forgiveness by a third person, on behalf of the culprits who wouldn’t ask for one themselves?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Okay, if the culprit doesn’t want to ask for forgiveness, no one can forgive for him. But if the culprit is not present, and his child asks for forgiveness, this means that through a process of education the child has understood that he can’t act, he can’t repeat the [parent’s] act. One can’t forgive through an intermediary while the culprit refuses to accept repentance. For me, that’s impossible. If someone says, “What my parents have done—and they didn’t have time to ask for forgiveness, but I’m absolutely certain that had they been here… And I’m here on their behalf and I am asking for your forgiveness.” In this way, there is at least an assurance that if this individual is asking for forgiveness in an honest and sincere manner, he wouldn’t repeat his parent’s actions. But if someone says, “Well, we have to finish the work” and his son comes up to me and says: “You have to forgive my father who is in the forests of Congo or elsewhere…” Well, listen, that makes no sense.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Can I ask a question? Yes, I wanted to ask you just now, when you were talking about reconciliation, how can the executioner recognize that he has been dehumanized, that he has done something dehumanizing, how can this happen? R.B.: —to understand that he has been dehumanized—  And that he has again become… What are the means to achieve this? How have others done that, in times of other genocides? Was there—?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE RICHARD BATSINDUKA-LS-English translation.docx,"Well, there is the effort of personal reflection that needs to be done and to come back to one’s own self, to define one’s self from before the act took place: “Who was I before?” Because there are three stages: before, during and after. Does the way a person behaves during the action determine the way a person will be after? So he says to himself: “Now I’m a criminal” or he goes into complete denial and always finds excuses for his actions, you see? To justify the unjustifiable, he finds reasons that are difficult to accept, it’s like the myth of Cain! So, you see, he’s trying to find a valid reason, but it’s not working at all, it will never be a genuinely valid reason because it eats him from the inside. That's why we say in Kinyarwanda and Kirundi: “You can run faster than the one chasing you, but you can’t outrun the one who’s running within you,” you see what I mean? So, how to remove that which is running within you? It is precisely to recognize what it is that is running within you. And before this thing ran within you, was that you? You see? How can I, before making the other two steps, return to that pervious state and say, “No, that’s unacceptable! I have to return to who I was before and rediscover my humanity.” But to go back to this humanity, one must also accept the inhumanity one has attained, either by oneself or by what you have learned from human experience, you see? So, the whole process of repentance begins with a personal conviction, to convince one’s self that: “Well, that's unacceptable, I did it, but I wasn’t like that before. How can I go back to who I was before? I can’t deny what I’ve done.” That’s it.",Interviewee,Tension

So, wherever we are, we—every Rwandan wherever he is, should be aware that if we ever want to become Rwandans again, we have to go through a very long process of education, of self-education, and to personally make the decision to become what we must become.

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"My mother worked during the day, while we were at school, so when we came home after school she was always there. Sometimes, my dad worked at night because he was a doctor, but that wasn’t his regular schedule, it didn’t happen often… So almost every night we were at home with our parents.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Would you say that both of them, equally, were looking after the children, or was one of them more involved in the children’s upbringing than the other?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"It depends on the activity. I remember that my mother taught me how to do “girls’ stuff”—how to sew, how to make the bed, how to fold clothes, how to sweep, how to clean, how to… These are things that my father never taught me, it was my mom who showed me that. While my dad—he was telling me about history, he was showing me some technical stuff—that was more his domain. In terms of school work, my father was helping me with math and related subjects and my mother, with language and other related subjects. So I knew that for math homework, I could ask my father for help and when it was something in French or Kinyarwanda, I could ask my mother.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Would you tell us how did you perceive your parents’ relationship, how—what can you tell us about their life as Mom and Dad, as told from the perspective of their child?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,As parents?,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,…,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I would say that as parents they were very strict. [laughs] I don’t know how you say that in French—the kind of parents who would look at you from the corner of their eye and, without them having to say anything, you would know what mistake you’ve made and you would correct the mistake at the same time. It was—in any case, I think—not that I regret it, but I think we had a very strict upbringing.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"But they would also show affection, love, tenderness…",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, we were spoiled as children, but that didn’t mean that we weren’t punished when we made mistakes. But when we weren’t causing any trouble, we were pampered. We ate out at the restaurant at least once a week, on Saturday nights. We rented movies—not during the week because those were school nights. And we went to the park on Saturday evenings. We went on airplane tours. We were more than spoiled, I would say.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Turning now to your studies—when did you start elementary school and then what did you study in high school?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I started kindergarten when I was three years old and when I was five, I think, I started elementary school. I finished it at 12. I started high school at the age of 13. So, the first four years of school was the common core education, without specialization. Later, when I started fifth grade—since I was in a high school in Benin—we had to choose a specialization in fifth, sixth and seventh grade, and I continued in accounting.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"The choice, or the fact that you went into accounting—was that your choice or was it the choice of the family? How did you choose…?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"When the time came to make a choice, I didn’t know what [laughs] to choose, but I was—because I was quite good at math, I went into accounting. At first, I wanted to study medicine, but I didn’t like—for that I had to take physics and I hated physics. So I decided to study something that was easy for me and I didn’t have to deal with physics, so I went into accounting, and that’s how it happened. [laughs]",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"[laughs] Before we turn to Benin, what are your memories of your neighbourhood in Kigali? When you look back on that time, how do you see your life with those around you, with the children in your neighbourhood or your classmates? You come from, if I may say, a well-to-do family, both of your parents worked. Was this common in your neighbourhood or were there differences? How would you describe the people in your neighbourhood, compared to your family?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"In the neighbourhood, I would say that what “well-to-do” meant was relative, but we were—some families were richer, others poorer, so I would say ours was maybe in the middle. At school we were—I went to school with the children of ministers and so on, so I would say that my classmates’ families were much better-off than us.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"After school, could you go to the school yard and play with everyone?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,No. [laughs] No. So the way we were taught was that our parents would come to pick us up after school and we went straight home. We weren’t allowed to go anywhere unless our parents came with us or unless we were going to visit cousins or family friends with our parents. The only friends we had in the neighbourhood were our neighbours with whom we could talk over the fence.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I don’t know if you’ve ever asked yourself this question, but I'll take this opportunity to ask you: Do you think there was a particular reason for that? The fact that after school the children went straight home? As far back as you can remember or if you think about it now, what would the reason for that be?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I’ll express my personal opinion about this. I’d say that it wasn’t only a question of education in the sense that parents didn’t want their children to socialize with—I’d say, with just anyone… I think they were also concerned about the children’s safety. These are the two reasons that come to mind.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"You said that you went to high school in Benin. Tell me, how did you find yourself in Benin?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Actually, after the genocide, the NGO where my mother worked opened a branch in Benin. I don’t know how it happened and my mom had to—in any case, she was transferred from Rwanda to Benin and we had to leave with her.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Do you remember how you prepared for this move from one country to another?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"The moment that always comes to my mind is when my mother told us we were leaving. She told us—because we were going to school at the time, I think it had been a few weeks since the beginning of the school year—she told us, “You’ll have to study French harder, because in your new school you’ll be studying in French only.” The idea of leaving was exciting to me, but the fact that I was going to be in a school, in an environment where we only spoke French and that maybe I wouldn’t be able to express myself correctly was scaring me. Apart from that, the other [?] was leaving the people I’ve grown up with, my cousins, and knowing that I wouldn’t be able to see them anytime I wanted, that was also bothering me a little. But I was delighted by the idea of ​​change and exploring something new.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,And so you left Rwanda and you went to Benin. How did you adapt to life in the new country? How did you experience this as a family and personally?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"For sure, the beginning was difficult for me and my brothers and sister precisely on account of the language because we were in a place where we didn’t speak the language, so it wasn’t easy. We arrived in January, so right in the middle of the school year, and we had to adapt, stay on track, learn French, adapt and at the same time not fall behind, which was much more difficult. It was also a cultural shock, because these are two completely different cultures, and settling down was difficult too. But I don’t know if it was because we were young or because I myself was young, but I’d say that it didn’t take too long before I felt almost at home there.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Were you welcomed in that country?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, I remember that when I arrived in the school I was introduced to the students in my class, and everyone was trying hard to help me, to explain things, to give me their notes to copy, and this felt good because when you go someplace new, you feel quite—you think to yourself, “Will everything be okay?” and all that. But when people would come up to me at recess and say, “Don’t worry, you can copy my notes”—the teachers would also come up to me and say, “Come to see me if you need explanations”—that was reassuring. But the fact that we were far from our family, far away, and that we didn’t know almost anyone there, that part wasn’t easy.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How old were you when you left for Benin?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Thirteen years old. I celebrated my 13th birthday—it is in January—so I celebrated my 13th birthday there.,Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, I started high school there.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How did your mom balance work with taking care of the children?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"[laughs] I still wonder to this day. Because not only she was working and taking care of the children, I think it also fell on her to do the greatest share of the work of finding out how things functioned in the new place. To this day, I don’t understand how she did it, with four children. If I were in her place, I don’t think I would have succeeded. I’m still asking myself this. I think she is the right person to ask this question to.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I’m curious to know—when you look at your life now, how your life is going, and when you think about your mom, do you see any character traits that you can say, “I get that from my mom”?",Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Like what?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Not just from my mom [?]. But from her I think I have that go-getter attitude, I must have inherited that from her. The resourcefulness, always wanting to go forward despite the obstacles on the way—this comes, I’m sure, from my mother. Another trait is the love for Rwandan culture—that, I think, one hundred percent is from her, one hundred percent. That little bit of calm disposition that I have, I think it’s from my mom too… [laughs] Reading—I don’t remember if my dad liked to read much, but I know my mom loves it, so I have that from her as well.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,And what traits have you inherited from your dad?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"From Dad? First, him being a doctor, he was more interested in mathematics, chemistry, things like that and so I must have gotten that from my dad. Apparently, my dad also had a strong character, so that too must come from him… What else? The side of me that wants success not only for myself but for the people around me as well, the side that likes to help others, the generous side—that, I think, I also carry from my dad.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How did you live through the 1994 period?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I’d say that when experiencing such atrocities I don’t think you make the effort to think about what will happen tomorrow, you live day-by-day. Actually, not even day-by-day, you live in the present moment, really, and you wait to see what happens next.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Did you at all see it coming?,Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,What were some of the signs that you remember now?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"For two or three years before 1994 the national security in the country wasn’t good, there were always demonstrations. The fact that at school the Hutus were asked to stand up and people from the other ethnicity were also asked to stand up and both were counted—that was one of the signs. And the fact that we had already been attacked once at home before 1994 also had to be a sign that something was wrong, yeah.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,So at school people from the different ethnic groups were asked to stand up?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, they would ask the students from one ethnic group to get up, they would count them and tell them to sit back down and then ask the students from the other ethnic group to get up, and so on. And there was a form we had to fill in and we had to indicate our ethnicity, our names, our parents’ names, where we were born and so on and the question about ethnicity was also on there…",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How does a child of a school age know what ethnic group they belong to? Did you know that?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I don’t know how I came to know it, but I did [laughs], I knew it. It's a form that we’ve had to fill in since we were young, when we were in kindergarten, I think, we were given that form to fill in at home and bring back. And when we were in elementary school we would fill it in ourselves, and if we didn’t know how to fill in certain parts, we had to ask our parents and the next day we would bring the missing information to our teacher.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"And did you find that your teachers—once they knew to which ethnicity their students belonged—did you observe any difference in the way the teachers took care of, or helped, or in general treated the students?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Personally, I was too young, I didn’t notice that. It’s possible that was the case, but personally I didn’t realize it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"So going back now to the period of 1994, during the genocide—you saw it coming, but how did you live through that time?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How do you mean?,Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"How did it all happen in your family? You made it through, but other members of your family didn’t. I don’t know if you could…",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"So, how it happened… I remember, it started in the evening, we were having dinner, it was around 8 o’clock in the evening, my paternal uncle was there with us, on his vacation. We were at the table, having dinner, and then we heard the sound of the plane. I didn’t realize it was the sound of the plane because we were always hearing that kind of noise, grenades, here and there, and I thought that it was just the usual. Then my father asked us to go to bed—actually, not to bed but to go under the beds, because every time this happened, we were told to hide under the bed until my parents would come and tell us to… And then, a few minutes later, we were told: “Come out from under the bed and go to sleep.” Then they woke us up only the next day—because I was getting ready—I remember, I was preparing to write the final exam at the end of high school [Translator’s note: or elementary school?] and I was taking classes—it was Easter vacation, but I was taking extra classes to prepare for my exam. So when they came to wake us up, I got up quickly to go take a shower, because I thought I was late for school. And my dad followed me and said “No, you’re not going to school today.” Then I saw that they were laying down mattresses in the corridor, and my father told us, “Sit down, we'll explain what's going on.” So they laid the mattresses down, they arranged all that and said, “In fact, the president's plane has been shot down and things are not going well at all for the moment, we're going to stay here until the situation improves.” I was so young that I didn’t understand how great the danger was. I said, “So I'm not going to school?” My father said, “No, you’re not going to school until things get better.” I said, “Okay, no problem.” And so we stayed in the house. The plane was shot down on the 6th at night and we stayed there until the 11th. It was on the 11th that we were attacked in the house. I remember that when it happened my father went out, we stayed behind—no—yes, we stayed behind—my mom and my brothers, my sister and uncle. Just before he went out, my father said, “Let’s sit together and pray.” We took a few minutes to pray and then my father went out of the house. My mother told me to get my brothers and sister and go hide under my parents’ bed, then she closed the door and said, “I'll come to get you soon.” We stayed there, but I could hear noises, there were noises. I remember I came out from under the bed and I went to the window. I saw my father being struck, and I went back under the bed. But I didn’t say anything to my brothers, I was speechless. A few minutes later, someone entered the room. My sister said, “Daddy is back.” But it wasn’t our dad, it was someone else. He started searching, rummaging around the room… And when he looked under the bed—there we were. He told us to come out, and so we did, he told us to go outside, and we followed. So we were there and I didn’t know what had happened to my mother, I didn’t know how my father was doing, and all that. I didn’t know what had happened to my uncle or to the servants either. We were standing in front and then the man asked me, “Are you the eldest child in the family?” I said, “Yes, I'm the eldest.” He said, “Where do your parents keep the money, the guns, and all that?” I said I didn’t know, I said that I had never seen any guns in the house. I said that I really didn’t know. I told him, “You can ask Mom or Dad, I don’t know.” Then he began to tease me: “Oh, those rich kids, it’s always the same thing.” He told many stories and then he said: “Anyway, it doesn’t matter if you know or not. We’ll kill all of you and then we’ll search the house and we’ll find it.” I said, “I can’t tell you anything because I don’t know.” Then he told me, “Before we kill you, you’ll take this gun and you will kill your brothers.” I told him, “I don’t know how to use a gun,” that's what I said. And he said, “Oh yes, you do know. You, the inkotanyi children, you all know how to use guns.” So he handed the gun over to me, I remember that it was very heavy. He said, “So, there, you’re going to kill them quickly, then we’ll kill you, then we'll get on with what we need to do, and then we’ll leave.” I remember that he gave me the gun and I gave it back and said, “Look, do what you want, I can’t kill my brothers.” The man said, “Oh no? In any case, if you don’t kill them, we’ll kill you all.” And I said, “Do what you want, I’m not going to kill my brothers.” So he stayed there and a few minutes later, my mom came out of the house accompanied by somebody else, I think he was the leader of the whole gang. They came out and he said to the guy who was with us, “Leave them alone, I made an arrangement with the lady, let them go. I don’t think they’ll go far, anyway…” So my mother said to me, “We’re going to the neighbours’.” We passed through the fence and we went to the neighbours’ house. Of course, when they had heard that we were being attacked, they had fled, so when we got there, the house was empty. Meanwhile, I think they had told my mother that my father was dead and my mother could not stop crying, and we didn’t understand why… We kept asking her, “Mom, what is it? What's wrong?” And she kept saying, “It's going to be all right, it's going to be all right.” [Tears] [Temporary break in the recording] Afterwards, when my mother—my mom calmed down later and she told us, “Your father is dead.” In the meantime, while my mother was out, my uncle had also left. They had tried to cut off his arm and he was bleeding; we tried to stop the blood with a cloth. We stayed in the house, we waited for the neighbours to come back, we just stayed there, and then, much later, they returned. So the man—in the house where we were—he said, “You can’t stay here because they know you’re here, and if they know it, we’re next.” And then even I said, “Where do you think I can go with the kids?” He begged us to leave and then he said, “Okay, no problem, you can sleep here tonight, but tomorrow morning you’ll have to start making arrangements and see where you can go.” So, we went to bed and I think that during the night, my mother and my uncle went to the neighbours’ to see if there was a place for us to stay, but—and I found that out the next day—that plan didn’t work. And I know that in the house where we were, the whole family was about to leave and go to Butare. So Mom asked them, “Can you take us with you?” But the man said, “Listen, we can’t,” and so on. My mother then asked if they could at least drop us off at the house of my mother’s older brother who lived in Kiyovu. Then suddenly it started to rain. It was raining heavily. Now that it was raining, the man said, it was certain that the guards at the roadblocks would leave their posts and so we could go, but he would only drive us to my uncle’s. So we got to my uncle’s house, we knocked on the door, we knocked, we knocked and there was no one… Fortunately, there was a small opening at the bottom of the fence. My mom said to me: “Go and see if there’s anyone in the house.” I passed through and I went upstairs. My uncle and his family weren’t there, only the guard whom I knew and who said: “Listen, unfortunately, you can’t stay here because there is someone watching the neighbourhood and he knows that there are two of us here in the house, if they find you here, they’ll kill us all.” So I went back and told that to my mom and the others. In the meantime, my mother had an idea—my uncle’s family had a friend who worked at the Belgian Red Cross, which was not too far away. So Mom said, “You’re going to drop us off there and the Red Cross probably—they will shelter us.” So, they dropped us off there and they left. Once we arrived, we asked for the friend of my uncle’s family, he came out, saw us—he knew us—and he said: “Unfortunately, they don’t shelter refugees here.” He said, “There’s another branch of the Belgian Red Cross further down, we will send you there.” My mom said: “With all the roadblocks, we won’t be able to pass through.” And he said, “Okay.” He took one of the cars of the Red Cross, we got in, and he said, “Listen, we're going to pass through as if we”—we were hidden at the back of the car—“we're going to pretend that it’s a Red Cross vehicle passing… If they stop us, unfortunately there is nothing we can do, but if they don’t stop us, great.” But it was still raining so every time we came up to a roadblock, it was empty, so we passed through and they left us there. They dropped us off at the Red Cross and there were other refugees living there, about sixty or so people, families, and so on. So they left us there and that’s where we stayed. In the beginning, everything went well, we had food to eat, but sometimes there wasn’t any food left and they told us that we would divide the work by family. Each family—they said that we were going to have a schedule of people who would do the cleaning, people who would do the dishes, people who would cook—who would go get food, people who would go get water. Because I was the eldest in the family, I was told, no problem, I can help with the cooking, but for those going out—my mom couldn’t go out, and so they said, “Look, you're the eldest, you have no choice.” I said, “Okay.” Anyway, I was young—getting water? No problem! But we had to get water for bathing, for washing the dishes, for cooking. So I said, “Listen, I don’t mind going, but how will I manage?” They said, “No problem, we’ll think of something.” Then they said, “We'll do two rounds because not everyone can go out at the same time.” And since they designated only one family member per activity, I said: “I’ll go out in the first round and will come back in the second, it’s not a problem.” Someone was surveilling the neighbourhood. Apparently, they were going to kill us at the very end, after they had finished killing everyone else, we were to be the dessert, that's why—because no one was protecting us at the Red Cross, and there was this man who told us that they were going to kill us in the end. There was a roadblock right at the entrance of the Red Cross; so every time we went out to get water, this man accompanied us, we would get water and come back. So I would leave with the first group, give the water to my mom and come back with the second group, and so on. One day we went out and they started shooting at us. When shots are fired, everyone starts running here and there. I remember I ran, I went into a house, I didn’t know where I was, I climbed a tree and sat there and waited. They were shooting, shooting, shooting... At one point, I don’t know what happened, but the shooting stopped. Quietly, I climbed back down from where I was, in the tree, and I was looking for the man because I knew that he was going to protect me—and I had been tracking his movements with my eyes. So when everything calmed down, I climbed down and followed the man. Everybody came out of their hiding places except one guy who was shot and we took him back to the Red Cross. After that, we just continued on our way to get water and then we returned to the house. I think my mother was scared and she said: “I don’t think you’ll be going alone next time.” So from then on, my brother went with me. And we continued going as usual. One morning, apparently someone from the Red Cross had fired bullets at the roadblock at the entrance. So the interahamwe came and said: “We won’t wait until the end, after all.” We were all taken out of the house, we were taken outside and they said: “Say your prayers now, we will kill you.” We were all sitting in a row, I remember I was with my mom and I don’t know where my sister and my brothers were, but in any event, we were the last ones in the row. I don’t remember where my brothers were. We started praying, and then they killed the first person in the line, I think it was a mother with her baby, then the second, and then the man who was surveilling the neighbourhood showed up. He said, “But why are you killing these people?” And they said, “Wasn’t it them who shot at us?” The man said, “No, no, no, I know this house, I’ve searched it, there are no guns here,” and stuff like that. Anyway, he said, “I told you, we’ll kill these people towards the end.” And so they let us go, we went back into the house. This happened, I think, twice. The first time, they killed people, but the second time one person was wounded, but no one died. So we stayed there and I continued going out as if that was my normal. I said to Mom, “Don’t worry, I'm not going to die.” I don’t know why, but I was sure I wasn’t going to die. All three [Translator’s note: or five?] of us stayed there. I went out every day to fetch water, to get some food with the others. Even when my brothers didn’t come with me, I would still go, because I was sure that nothing was going to happen to me. I went out every day. I saw the killings in some places, but I had gotten to a point where it didn’t shock me anymore, they could shoot someone and I could pass nearby without a problem. As long as they didn’t touch me—that’s what was scaring me. My mother would ask me, “Have you seen the dead people?” And I would say, “They are everywhere.” It has become just a normal thing for me that one person would kill another; I saw a woman being raped and it seemed normal to me. All I was doing was to go out, get water and bring it back, because I didn’t want my family to starve. Then finally, one morning we woke up and the roadblock was gone. Someone looked out the door and the people who were guarding the roadblock were no longer there. Then I think someone turned on the radio—the radio wasn’t working. We wondered what was going on, and, I think as a reflex from the war, we said, “Let’s get ready, something is happening, we should leave.” We got dressed, we started packing a few small things, because we thought we were going to change locations, and while we were getting ready a soldier arrived. I remember my mother cried out, “It’s the inkotanyi.” [laughs] And my mom said, “Don’t take too many things with you because they [the soldiers] have arrived.” I remember I was packing and I was asking, “Mom, should we take this?” She was saying, “No, no, no, don’t worry, we’re safe.” [laughs and tears of joy] And then she said to me and my brothers, “Don’t worry, everything is fine.” I remember we were the second ones to go out, there was one guy in front of us and then me and my mom, and she said, “Go where this gentleman tells you to go, because it’s fine, we’re safe.” [laughs] Then they took us to a place called [inaudible]. Everyone from Kiyovu was there, well, from the neighbourhood anyways. They took us there, they gathered us to tell us that the war was over and that we were going to stay there until they found a safe place for us to go because there were grenades everywhere and it wasn’t safe. I remember that they brought us food, they gave us to eat, and told us that the next morning we were going to Kicukiro. We were to walk from Kiyovu to Kicukiro. I said, “Mom, how are we going to walk?” [laughs] Mom said, “Now that we’ve gotten this far, we’ll do whatever it takes, if we have to walk, you’ll walk.” Mom said, “In any case, don’t take too many things with you because we’re safe and these people will feed us at the place where we’re going.” The next day they told us, “It’s time to go.” We gathered our things, yes, and we set off for Kicukiro. And everyone—each family was assigned to a house. We were told, “This is a safe place, you’ll stay here a few days until we secure the rest of the city.” I think we stayed there for at least—I think a week, the equivalent of a week. After that they said, “You can now go back to your homes.” When we returned to the house—I wasn’t—my mother was accompanied by someone, I don’t know who—apparently, we couldn’t live in our house because it wasn’t a pretty sight—in any case, I didn’t know what it looked like. We were told to go sleep at my aunt’s house. When they had brought us all together in that place, we reunited with one of my aunts. She had lost her children. She was my godmother. She [Yvette’s mother] told us, “You, your sister and your brothers are going to stay with your godmother and I will stay with your other uncle” with whom we had also reunited. “We’ll clean the house and once it’s ready you’ll come too.” I think I stayed with my aunt for two days, the time it took to put the house in order a little bit, and then we returned home.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,How was the return to everyday life after all this? How was life in Kigali and how does one go on after something like that?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Speaking for myself, I think that it was like the two sides of a mirror: I was a spoiled child who had suddenly become an adult. I realized that life would never be the same. I don’t know how I understood that, but it was like a mirror, yes. We stayed there, we tried to clean the house—the places where there was blood, all the books that were on the floor because they had ransacked everything. We cleaned the house and, fortunately, not long after, the NGO where my mom worked restarted—they opened for business again and Mom had to go back to work. Since I was the eldest in the family, I had to take over the responsibilities of the house, I had to make sure that we had something to eat, I cooked, I cleaned the house… I had to get my brothers organized—I knew that this brother had to get up and clean this room or that brother had to get up and do something else. I knew when we had to go get water and I learned to clean and cook by myself. I was trying to remember what our servants did when I was little and when I was watching them work. I was improvising. In any case, I know that when Mom would come home from work, everything was in order. How did I do it? I don’t know. But I knew that it had to be done, because Mom was working, she couldn’t be in two places at the same time, so I learned all of this by myself. Of course, when Mom was home, I would sit next to her, ask her questions: “How do I do that? How is this done? What do you think I should do tomorrow?” She would tell me, but I knew that I had to take on responsibility for everything to be in order when she came home from work.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"So Mom went back to work, and when did you, the kids, go back to school?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I think we went back to school—if I remember correctly, it was two months later, I think in October? Yes, I think it was October when we went back to school. Two months later.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Did you go back to the same school?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Yes, I went back to the same school. Of course, I didn’t know 90% of the faces there. I remember there was a girl I went to elementary school with. When I saw her after the war—she was the first one I saw—I think we hugged and we stayed in each other’s arms for a long time because she was the only one I knew from school from before. And to see her alive, it felt good. And I remember there was a teacher who came up to me and said, “No, no, no, you can’t be alive.” I said, “Yes, I'm here.” There was also a boy who was back—I remember we were in fifth grade together before the war. I didn’t recognize him because they had cut him all over his body. I didn’t recognize him, and the girl asked me, “Did you recognize Ange?” I said, “That’s Ange? No, I didn’t recognize him.” I felt so bad for not having recognized him, someone who had been part of my life from before, who felt much closer to me after the war than the others, especially those returning from outside of the country—he was like [part of?] my family. Not recognizing him really affected me deeply. But, for sure, when school started, those of us who were in Rwanda after the war, we stuck together. The people who came back from Burundi, they kept their distance. And so did the people who came back from Uganda. That’s how it always was. And I remember our conversations: “How did you survive? What happened? How are you doing? Are your parents still alive? Are your sisters still alive?” That was it, at least for the first two weeks we only talked about that. About nothing else.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I think, from the teachers who had taught me before, there was only one at the school after the war. Only one was there. There were five sixth grade classes and we had about five teachers, and I knew only one of them from before.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"How was the relationship between—well, you said they were keeping their distance, depending on whether they had stayed in Rwanda or returned from elsewhere. And the teachers, how did they treat the children, in your view, when you look back, what was the teachers’ attitude towards the children after the war?",Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"The trauma, that’s it. It was a recurrent thing. You would be studying and all of a sudden you would hear someone scream—things like that. It affected us, but I think it affected the teachers more. They not only had to ensure the well-being of the students, to teach them in class, the class material and all that, the knowledge they had to transmit, but also take care of these children who were not doing very well. So it was a combination of these three things, and I imagine they themselves were not feeling—anyway, I think that, psychologically, they weren’t able to combine these three roles. I guess they had to do it, they had no choice.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I wonder if, as the 12-year-old children that you were, you trusted the teachers.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Trust—my thinking was, “I have to go to school” and “Life goes on, you have no choice.” Whether you trusted others or not, you had to fight, you had to go forward. Whether you liked it or not, you thought to yourself, “Yes, what happened, happened.” Now I understand: whether we like it or not, life continues, we had to fight to survive and continue to live.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Since we’re talking about school, when you reflect on that time, was there a teacher that influenced you, that you appreciated, or who appreciated you? Is there a teacher in particular that you remember?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"In elementary school, this teacher—the fact that after the war, he came up to me and said, “You are alive? I'm glad you're here.” That touched me. It felt like there was at school, besides my friends, an adult that I knew or at least someone I could talk to, someone who knew me from before. And what he said was reassuring: “If there is anything I can do, I’m here for you, I can help you.” It affected me, but it didn’t—it touched me, but not so deeply. For me, at the time, that wasn’t essential. I told myself that I had to live and the rest was not that important.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,What motivated you to go to school at that time?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I could see how my mom was fighting and I was thinking, “If she’s fighting like that, me, as the eldest in the family, I have—,” I thought I had the duty not only to continue going to school in order to succeed, but also in order to help my mom. I was thinking that she couldn’t continue going it alone. That’s what motivated me. And I was also thinking, “I am lucky to still have my mom, there are people who have lost their mothers.” So if I still have her and she is taking care of us, I thought “I have to do the impossible to move forward, to succeed and to lighten her load.” That’s what motivated me, because I remember that before the war, I went to school for the sake of going to school. I remember that if I placed 19th or lower in my class, that was a perfect score for me. As long as I wasn’t 20th, because I thought that being in 20th place was low, but up to 19 was perfect. I had never wanted to be first, second, all that. I wasn’t concerned with this because what mattered for me at school was to see my friends. And since I knew I was going to be scolded at the end of the semester [if I had bad grades], I would do everything I could so as not to be 20th in my class. But after the war, right after the war, I was first in my class because I understood better than before the use of school. That's why I said that before and after was like the two sides of a mirror.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"No, we never found his body, we were not able to bury him. [People say?] that he’s in either Nyanza or Kicukiro[?], but we really don’t have any confirmation about that. We tried—we know that the person who killed my father is still in Kigali. Apparently, during the gacaca—I wasn’t there—he was presumed innocent. The trial is still going on, it’s not over yet. But to date, unless he accepts his wrongdoing and tells us what happened—where he [the body of Yvette’s father] is now, so far we don’t know.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Speaking for myself? I don’t think I would have the strength to pursue this, I don’t think I have the energy. I appreciate the people in Kigali who follow up on this, it’s good if they do it, but personally, I don’t think I have that energy. The only motivation that would make me do it is to find out where the body of my father is, but the rest—attending the gacaca and all that—it’s good, but I don’t think I have enough energy to do that. Even if I were there, in Rwanda, I don’t think I would have the energy to do it.",Interviewee,Tension

That would be the only way. Or, if all of a sudden people who were there at the time and who know what happened—if they tell us… That would be the only way.

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"It's a good question. I don’t know. We think we’d meet them, but meeting someone who says “No, I didn’t do that,” yet we know they have, it’s also—in any case, I am reluctant. I am not so sure. But sometimes I think to myself: “I would like to meet this person and look at him.” To be face-to-face with him, to at least ask him a few questions. But I think it would anger me more, it would make me even more—if he says, “No, I didn’t do that,” I don’t know if I could handle it. Knowing that he’s done it and that he says no, that’s what I doubt very much. I find it’s too—I think it's the highest level of viciousness. We’re not asking for much, we want to know at least where the body is so we can bury it. But to meet with someone who might know where the body is and would not say, I'm not sure that I could handle it.",Interviewee,Tension

I was trying hard to look on the bright side, to see my family that I hadn’t seen, my uncles, my aunts, my cousins… I don’t think that—I was trying not to mention it.

I would like to relive that month as I lived through it in 1994.

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"It's like I say, it was the first time that—pardon me—that I was leaving my family, and I thought it was a crazy thing to do. I wasn’t even eighteen years old yet, it was an adventure. It was absolutely an adventure. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into, I didn’t have any expectations. I thought, “I’ll go and then we’ll see.” I had no expectations, I didn’t know what I was getting into and I thought, “I'll go, if it works—great, if it doesn’t work—hey, we'll try something else.”",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I think it was hard for her to let me go because it was the first time she was separating from one of her children. I don’t think she realized it until the last day or maybe she was hoping I would come back. But I was thinking, “Not being next to her doesn’t mean that I’m not helping her.” And I was also thinking: “I want to go there, I want to leave for—.” As the saying goes, you have to take a step backwards in order to make a better jump forward. In my mind, that’s why I did it. It was crazy, because I was young and I didn’t have a precise plan and all that, but it was really with the intention to move forward and become someone, to be able to reach my goals, that was the reason why. It was really a crazy thing to do, leave your parents while you are still under 18, go to Canada, a country, I don’t know how many thousands—from your parents, it's crazy. I don’t think that my children would do something like that. [laughs]",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Because I was with my cousin, I had someone who was helping me do this and that. That was helpful. Also I was still a minor and I went back to high school. That was easy. That's what made my integration easier because when you start school, you make contacts. I started school, I was at the end of high school, so I finished high school. And I remember, I started in Grade 10 and when the school year finished everyone was looking for work and so I said “Let's go! Let’s find a job.” I remember I didn’t know where to start. I remember I was buying something at Zellers and there was a line-up, a long line. And I thought, “These people are probably looking for cashiers.” [laughs] I went home, printed my CV, went back to the store, gave it to them and said, “I think you're looking to hire people.” I told this to the person there because there was a long queue. And it was true. I handed in my CV, say today, and two days later they called me, they interviewed me and I started work on Monday. So I worked there during the summer and in September I went back to school. They kept me working part-time because I was going to school. I went to school in the mornings and I was working a few evenings and on the weekend. There was a project with the Bank of Montreal [BMO] through my school, the bank wanted to integrate young students into the financial sector. So they would go into Montreal schools and select a maximum of three students per school, and they chose me. After they selected me, I did the internship once a week. I worked at the bank as an intern and I learned in this way what the job of the people at the bank entailed. And when I graduated from high school, they called me to ask if I was looking for a job. I said yes. The woman who was coordinating the internship told me, “I’ll keep your CV, if you’re ever looking for a job.” And when they had a job opening she said to me: “Listen, there are jobs that have become available, I'm going to send your CV, so expect us to call you if you are selected.” Finally, they called me and I got the job at BMO, and I worked there.

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"Does one have to be Rwandan to notice it? Because I am Rwandan, I don’t know if people who see—but as a Rwandan, yes, I am aware of it. Does one have to absolutely be [Rwandan] to understand it? I don’t know. Maybe yes, I don’t know.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,Do you think there is hostility present within these groups or is it just group dynamics?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"I think it’s just group dynamics. Bringing together the two ethnicities is not something that can happen in two years or five years. If it is to happen at all, it will take time and there will be a learning curve, and it will be long-lasting. I don’t think it's something that should be forced or pushed either, we really have to let time do its work.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"No, I would say they have changed, especially when I look at the young people. The young people have the desire to make sure that our country advances. We want things to be better for the country, we really want it to move forward, we want the Rwanda of tomorrow to be a different Rwanda from the one we have known.",Interviewee,Tension

And not only about those events—we could address all kinds of issues. But we often talked about what had happened in Rwanda, about education today compared to the education of our parents or our grandparents, yes, we often referred to that.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"What bothers me and affects me the most is the negationism, the fact that despite everything that has happened, that has been recorded on camera, the people who have lived through it, the victims who continue to testify, there are still people who dare say that there was no genocide—I don’t support that.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE YVETTE ISHIMWE-LS-English translation.docx,"The future is based on the past. This means that, whether I like it or not, what happened is going to influence what I am doing now and what I will be doing in the future. This means that what I have seen and what I have lived through will be reflected in my every decision or every action. And I think to myself that, yes, what I’ve lived through was an atrocity, but at the same time it awoke a part of me that keeps telling me that life did not stop, life goes on and that we must not just survive, we must live. Whatever the obstacles you encounter in life, whoever you meet on your journey, don’t hesitate to move forward. And I think—as they say in English, last but not least—I think that if I am who I am, if I am where I am, it is all because of God. And I say to myself, “Everything I've lived through, everything I do, everything I know—if I didn’t have God, if I didn’t have prayer, I wouldn’t be here.” There’s no doubt about that.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I was born in the eastern part of the country, which is now the Eastern Province—it was called Kibungo Province before—in the former Rusumo District, which is now the Kirehe District, I guess. And we lived in Nyarubuye, right next to the church, the Nyarubuye church. We lived nearby. I lived there with my parents and other family members.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Before we continue, I would like to ask you about the people who formed the core of your family. You said that you were five children, and it is you I am meeting here today. Are the other members of your family—parents, brothers and sisters—still there?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, unfortunately, they are not. I lost my whole family in the 1994 genocide of the Tutsis. In the aftermath of the genocide, I found myself the only survivor in my family. No sisters, no brothers, no parents. They were all massacred at the church in Nyarubuye.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, yes.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,I would like to talk about your parents. What did they do for a living during your childhood?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"My father’s name was Wenceslas Kageruka, he was a teacher. He taught at the elementary school, but he was also a musician, he composed songs, mostly religious songs. There are many songs signed with his name, which are sung even to this day. And I thank him for that. My mother was a housewife, she looked after the housework and the children’s upbringing, and she took care of everything that needs to be done in the household of a family living in the countryside, in a village. We didn’t live in the city, we lived in a village, so she was taking care of farming, the cattle, she was the one who oversaw all these activities. And at the same time she participated in them herself. So she was always at home.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I want to go back to Dad who worked outside of the house. How did he reconcile work and—I imagine he was involved in the upbringing of the children too? When you look back at those years, how did he manage to have time to spend with the children? What was his contribution to his children’s upbringing?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"As I said in the beginning, my father was a teacher. So school and the education of the children was very important to him. He kept talking to us about school, about furthering our studies. He would tell us sometimes, “My children, because of the system, because of the situation in which we lived, I wasn’t able to go far in my schooling, but I ask that you study, for me.” That was his recurring message. That was his concern for his children, for the future of his children. And he was also someone who was strict about discipline. He tolerated zero errors, he didn’t tolerate any mistakes. I remember he would say to us, “My daughters”—my little sister Stéphanie and I, we were teenagers at the time, we were young teens and he would say to us, “My daughters, if ever you’re not back home by 6 o’clock in the evening, you might as well stay where you are.” So for him the discipline of his children was something very important. That’s it.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Okay. As you said, you were four girls and a boy in the family—when you look at the kind of education you received from him, was it the same for the boys as for the girls? Did both of your parents look after the boys in the same way as the girls or were the responsibilities divided: Mom was looking after the girls and Dad after the boys? I would like to know a little bit about how they managed the upbringing of both boys and girls in the house?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"In terms of education, my father was—you see, the context in which we grew up, traditionally one gave a lot of—I don’t know if it’s respect—a great deal of importance to the boys. And we were four girls and a boy. And my father had understood very early on what it means for children to be equal. He said—I remember well, I was the first-born, I was the eldest in the family and he called me Kageruka, he gave me his name. I have my father’s name. And he said, “I will give this name to the other children too, so that they all have my name and that none of them believes that they are more important than the others or that they are more loved, to prevent them from thinking there are some who are more favoured than others, to avoid favoritism.” So all five children were named Kageruka. And he said—he only had one son and he was always saying to him, “You are all equal. It’s not because you’re the only boy that you’ll dictate over your sisters, no. You are all equal, you all have my name, so in my eyes you are all equal.” So for him, there really wasn’t favoritism, no particular attention was paid to this or that child, we were all equal, he gave us as much as he could, he would talk to us, and he gave us words of  advice, in the same way for everybody. And my mother too was following the same approach. [laughter] She was following my father’s example. So it was always like that. But as girls, we sure had little secrets to share with our mother, but otherwise it was an environment that was good and supportive and instructive to everyone, without particular consideration—according to the child’s seniority, not according to gender.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Looking back still, when we grow up and especially when we remember our family lives, sometimes we say to ourselves, “This is what my parents were like, and now I think that I’ve taken this or that trait from my mother or from my father.” Looking back and thinking about both your parents and yourself, what features do you think you’ve inherited from both sides?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"That’s going to be difficult to answer—how can I say? I think I’ve inherited traits from both sides, I have traits from both sides. My mother was someone who cared about her children, who was affectionate, who wanted to make things available to her children, to always be present in our lives and I think I try to do the same to some extent. So taking care of the children, giving them affection, spending time with them, being present for every need of every child. It’s a difficult task, but I could see she was always trying. There were five of us, living in the countryside, and I could see her efforts. On my father’s side—I don’t know, maybe a little bit of his severity, towards my children, when I demand that they study. But on the other hand, my father influenced me in the sense that I always feel a duty to follow up on what he told me, what he asked of me. Even in terms of taking action, I don’t think I would be able to do everything my father did, because he did a lot, but I bear a burden of all the advice he gave us, of all the wishes he had for his children, I think that I carry this great burden within me; I find myself with a great many things to do, to bring to fruition, thanks to what my father communicated to us.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,What are these wishes? What were his wishes?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"His wishes were to see us grow well, to study, be useful to others, that’s it. These are traditional Rwandan values ​​for a child to grow into a successful woman or man. A successful child in the sense of—in the context of our country. So I always feel confronted with that, with what my father would say—and after the genocide, I didn’t know how to deal with this authority, with this brutal disappearance. But thanks to the advice, to the various and constant interventions of my parents, I was able to live through all that. So it’s something that helps me a lot.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,So they gave you a solid foundation.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, yes, yes. They really gave me a solid foundation. And if I am alive today, if you see me here in front of you, if I had been able to hold on, it’s because of my parents’ efforts from the time when I was with them. And that’s why, every time I see children who have lost their parents during the genocide at a young age, my heart aches because it is these internalized memories that can keep you going. We can hold on to them. I know that many children have been abandoned at one year of age, a month, at different ages, quite young, and my heart goes out to these children, I understand what they’re going through. It’s a miracle if they manage to pull through. I was able to carry on because of the memories I had. I carry them at all times, on every occasion. That’s what keeps me living.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,And speaking to someone who’s not of Rwandan origin…—it’s precisely these values that help you carry on. Can you describe them in more specific terms?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, it’s true, it’s a lot to take in for someone who isn’t Rwandan. There is the look in your father’s and your mother’s eyes, the way they spoke to you, the tone, the voice, the expression of the face, it’s the full picture. The words they were pronouncing all the time, their habits, their ways of doing things. And when I talk about my family—and not just my parents, but also our family friends, aunts, grandparents, it’s a mix—all these people, during the time you live with them, as a child, you observe. You see them doing things, you see how they address one situation or another; even if they don’t talk to you, you see how they react in one event or another, one situation or another. All that remains. It has stayed within me and it helps me a lot. It’s hard to describe it with words; we need to do some research [laughter] to be able to better describe it in a more comprehensive way, it’s not an easy thing to do. It’s not something to talk about in an interview and end it at that. It is a complex, mysterious thing that one lives with and internalizes without even making the effort. Ultimately, it is what forms the personality of the individual, in a sense, in the context of our culture.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You mentioned your extended family. I was going to ask if you had the chance to know your grandparents, if you have memories of your grandmother and grandfather on both sides. Did you have the chance to spend time with them? Do you have memories of your grandparents or of your extended family?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Both my parents had lost their parents—my grandparents—around 1959. They had lost them all. But there was one person that I can call my grandmother, she was the wife of my father’s uncle. She was the one who had educated my father. My father stayed with her; she took care of him after the disappearance of his parents around 1959—I don’t know the exact year, but it was during the events of 1959. They lived in Gikongoro at the time. It’s in the southwest part of the country, that’s where my father’s family is from originally. And in Gikongoro, it may be—I wasn’t born then yet, but when one reads the history, when one tries to understand what happened—it may be that in 1959 and the years that followed, there may have been an attempt at a genocide. An attempt at a genocide, which means that Gikongoro has experienced a genocide even before the genocide of 1994. So my father and mother were from Gikongoro and had lost a large part of their families, including their parents. But my father was able to stay with his uncle’s wife. She took care of my father and he brought her to Kibungo, so she lived close to our home in Kibungo with her children, whom I call uncles and aunts. They are the children of my father’s uncle’s wife—it’s a long story.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,So the family took care of your father.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, on my father’s side, that’s who I saw as family. And on my mother’s side, I knew my mother’s aunts. I knew her aunts, and also her sisters and brothers, I knew them, and, luckily, even today, some of them are still there after the 1994 genocide. I have several uncles on my mother’s side and several aunts, while on my father’s side, it’s as if the genocide of 1994 eradicated everyone who was still there. So on my father’s side I don’t really have any relatives left anymore, not many people. So I live with my relatives from my mother’s family.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,But you’re still able to stay in touch?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes. I manage to stay in touch. I have an uncle who lives in France, two aunts who are in Switzerland and another aunt who also lives in France. And I have many relatives in Rwanda—grandparents, my mother’s aunts. One person has had a great impact on me, her name is Alivera Beninka; she became a sort of a surrogate mother to me. She is my grandmother, but she takes care of me as if I’m her real daughter. And I even see her children as my big sisters or brothers, while they are in fact my aunts. So I’m happy with a life like that. That’s it. They love me very much, they take care of me, they call me on the phone, they have assumed the role of parents and are doing their best to fulfill it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I am taking the liberty to ask a few more questions about your family. [laughter] Sometimes we try to reach memories that are buried deep within us. I would like to go back to your relationship with your brother and your sisters. These are only memories, but looking back, and with the nostalgia we occasionally feel, what do you remember of the relationship with your sisters and your brother? I don’t know how old you were exactly when you lost them…",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I lost them in ‘94. I was born in 1971 and my little sister Stéphanie was born two years after me, so she was a teenager too, a teenager…",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Ten years old maybe…,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, more than ten years, because she was in high school. She was studying at a private school in Kigali, at the APAPE. So she must have been 15, something like that. And the other [sister] was around 12 years old.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,She was in 6th grade.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, 6th grade in primary school and 3rd grade in primary school. Three of us were in high school and two were still in primary school. So with my sister Stéphanie we played together a lot, we loved each other, we confided in each other, she asked me for advice because I was the oldest. And I felt responsible for my other sisters and my brother. So my behaviour always showed that sense of responsibility I had towards them. And, within certain limits, they accepted my authority. So that’s how it was. But what do I remember? I remember, for example, my little sister’s innocence. We called her the youngest in the house, her name was Claudine. She was the youngest, she was spoiled, she was—in 1994 I would say she was 8 years old, yes, around 8. And I remember her smile, she was beautiful—she had big eyes, she was a charming little girl, and very spoiled at home. And I remember that when we wanted to ask my father for something—to go play somewhere or go out of the house or visit friends—we would send little Claudine. She was the one who would ask our father for favours. [laughter] We knew that my father couldn’t refuse her anything. He loved to play with her; everyone loved her. So, if we asked our father if we could go outside of the house, he would surely say no. But by sending our little sister to him, it was a psychological game. By sending our little sister—she had a way to—it’s like she was playing in a comedy. She had a way to stand in front of Dad and present the request and the request was granted. [laughter] So that’s how it was. My brother Jean-Pierre, his name was Jean-Pierre, he was at the Petit séminaire in Zaza, in first or second year. Yes. What memories do I keep of him? It was as though he was following Dad’s path—he loved studying, he was brilliant. How do I remember him? Discipline. He was a disciplined guy and very responsible. He was young still, but I saw him as someone with a strong sense of responsibility. And that’s it. The other one was Assumpta. She was little. She was in 3rd grade in primary school. She liked being close to my mother, she never wanted to let go of my mother, she wanted to feel protected, but she was also adorable. They were all adorable. And I regret having lost them in this way, under such circumstances.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,It’s hard to realize that we’re talking about all of this in past tense.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, it’s very difficult.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Since we’re talking about your childhood, I would like to take you back to the eastern part of the country where you grew up, this time taking a look back at your neighbourhood. We talked a lot about your family, but families influence the neighbourhoods where they live or are influenced by their neighbourhood. Sometimes we think, “I miss this part of my childhood or I don’t miss that other part at all.” How do you see yourself in the place where you grew up? How do you see your family in this corner of your childhood?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"How do I see myself? We were a middle-class family, because we had fields, cows, so in terms of everyday life we didn’t have problems finding, say, food, milk, we were relatively well-to-do, not too much, but still, we had a certain standard of living in relation to all that. It wasn’t difficult to find food or drink. Also, my father was educated, he was teaching at the primary school, which meant that we had a relatively good life, compared to the villagers, if I can say so, to the people who—compared to many, many of the people who lived around us.  We lived very close to the church in the parish. We were always in contact with the priests, and there was also a community of nuns, the sisters of Benebikira. This was the same parish responsible for the primary school in Nyarubuye where we all went to school. So in the morning, we had to go to Mass, I remember, yes, every day. [laughter] Obeying my father’s discipline, we had to go to Mass. We had to read the Gospel at Mass. My task was—[laughter]—since we were living in the countryside, in the morning I had to go and fetch water, draw water. It was far: up the rocky mountains, carrying a jerrycan on my head, I had to drop off the water at home, around 7 o’clock… We would wake up very early. So if I didn’t go to draw water, I would clean the house and the yard, and everywhere before going to Mass. Mass began at 7 o’clock. So at 7 o’clock I was at Mass and school started at 8. And how do I see myself? We grew up in this environment where the church dominated. So we had to participate in these activities, because it was as if—it was also related to education, to school, the priest was the head of the primary school and the parish managed the school, so we were kind of stuck there. I grew up in these circumstances. We didn’t have many opportunities to play with the children in the neighbourhood because we didn’t feel at ease in the cultural context of Rwanda’s ethnic groups. So the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups had a big impact; there were a lot of Hutus living in the surrounding area. So we weren’t very—how should I say?—very free. There were limits… I grew up in this context.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And when you, once again, look back, you’re probably thinking that as kids you were not likely to go and play, to go meet with other kids because of the concerns you had about the ethnic groups. But how did the parents—how did you know that other kids were from the other ethnic group? How does a child of your age who is growing up realize that she’s different?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I don’t remember which year it was or how old I was when I realized that, but when I think about my childhood, I always see myself as stuck in this Hutu-Tutsi context. I don’t know when, I don’t know how old I was, but there wasn’t a moment when I wasn’t aware of it. Perhaps when I reached the age of reason, when I became aware of things, this context already existed, and that’s how I understood it at the time. And as we started primary school at the age of seven—so from that age, from the first year of primary school, we had to fill in these cards, each student had a card. And each student’s ethnicity was written on these cards. We were always asked what our ethnicity was and if you didn’t know it, you had to ask your parents. And your parents told you that you were either Hutu or Tutsi. Then, back at school, you had to say, “I’m Hutu” or “I’m Tutsi.” So, from an early age, at the age of seven, I knew that I was Tutsi because I had to tell that to my teacher. And I remember that there weren’t many Tutsis in my class. It was, like, two or three girls in the class and the others looked down on us, they were looking at us… There were very few of us, the majority of the class were Hutu, we were even ashamed to say that we were Tutsi. I was ashamed to say it. Because others looked at us as if we weren’t normal people or normal individuals. They were always looking down on us and every year we were asked that same question—in first year, in second, third, until the end of primary school. At the start of every new year in primary school, we were asked the same question. And each time, we were very embarrassed. We were embarrassed because of the look in other people’s eyes. And during recess they were pointing at us: he is Tutsi, she is Tutsi. So it was a difficult situation to come to grips with when you’re a child. It’s also true that sometimes we don’t even realize these things, we quickly forgot about it and we continued to play together, but when I remember this now I can see the extent to which we weren’t free, the extent to which we couldn’t enjoy our childhood.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And the teachers in all this? Once they knew who was Hutu and who was Tutsi, do you think they still treated you the same way? Or was there a difference in how they treated you once they knew who you were?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I didn’t notice anything particular on the part of the teachers until the end of primary school. They filled in the cards, they couldn’t do anything. And sometimes it was even the Tutsi teachers who did that, who were asking us that. They had no choice, they knew what the consequences were, but it was the norm, so they couldn’t do otherwise.

I remember the way he taught, how enthusiastic he was, how he succeeded in piquing our interest. And we anticipated French or math classes with great enthusiasm. That’s why I remember him. He taught us well. I liked those classes because of him. It was a pleasure to have these classes with him. And I have another memory of my father. It was in 1st or 2nd grade, we were learning to write. I was falling behind in reading and writing. I don’t know why, but I would write the letters backwards, A, B, C, I would write them backwards and for a long time my father, since he was a teacher, was helping me, teaching me to read and write properly. When he would come home he would bring me books to read; it was a hard time for me.

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It was hard, very hard with the quota system. The quota system was—there was a certain number, they had to—so it was the Ministry of Education that was in charge of all that. Tutsis didn’t have the right to continue their studies after primary school, it was hard for them to find a high school where they could study. And I think this was predetermined, there were mechanisms in place, every effort had been made to put barriers before the Tutsis. Even if you were brilliant, even if you had 90% [on the exams?], if you were Tutsi—because it was marked on the card and it was the ministry that kept those cards, so they controlled everything. It was very difficult. In order to go to high school, I repeated a year. The first time [I took the exam], I wasn’t successful, but since my father knew that I was capable, he made me repeat 6th grade. And the second time around it worked. I succeeded. Since he worked in the education system, he had expressed his concern. He had gone to see the inspector and had told him, “What happened? I want to see my daughter’s results. I don’t understand why she didn’t get accepted, she is smart. I don’t agree with the fact that she couldn’t pass.” So he fought for me and I repeated the year and the second time around I was able to pass. I was accepted to high school.

This was in Zaza, and right next to our school was Zaza’s Petit séminaire, where there were also Tutsis and where the Catholic church was training future priests. It was a good environment. But on the other side from us was the Zaza Groupe scolaire with Hutu students. [laughter] The students from our school were friends with the students from the Petit séminaire. So it was good, the director was good. And she—when something would happen—I noticed that she advised us as young Tutsi girls who shouldn’t have fun, who shouldn’t—how can I say?—she—when you made a mistake, no different than any teenage girl, she would say, “You too?

And if you made mistakes, if you were not disciplined, if you disobeyed the rules of the school, you could be expelled. That’s why, her being a Tutsi, she would say, “How dare you do that?

They are there, but with the genocide—in school it was as if we had forgotten everything, but the genocide of ‘94 revived all memories. Even if they’re there, I don’t have to talk to them. I have nothing to hide from them. Everything is clear. Yes. At the university, I met two girls I had gone to high school with—I didn’t pay any attention to them. I didn’t approach them and they too were afraid to come near me. I ignored them and they ignored me too. Because, you see, at the end of high school—I did well in high school, I finished third in my class, but I couldn’t—at the end of high school we had to pass yet another test to be admitted to university. I did the test, I was confident that I would pass. I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong, but when the list with names came out, I wasn’t on the list of those who were going to continue to university. And these girls had lower grades than me, and they had passed the test. It’s because they are Hutu—that’s what I said to myself. Maybe I am—maybe it’s true or maybe it’s not, but that’s the idea, that’s all I could understand. And after the genocide, they went back to university. Me too, I registered again at the university, and we met there. And there was a kind of mutual ignorance. We couldn’t communicate—everything was still fresh, everything was clear. There was no need pretending to be diplomatic.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,I’m going to ask: Did you see the events of ‘94 coming? How did you foresee the genocide?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Oh my god, what a question! [laughter] In fact, ‘94 didn’t just fall from the sky, it was prepared in advance. I remember, even when I was in high school in Zaza, so in the 1990s, when the inkotanyi attacked for the first time on October 1, 1990, it rattled all segments of the population, including students, teachers—everyone was aware of this attack and there were reactions all over the country. And I also remember the death of General Fred Rwigema. He was the commander of the RPF forces and when he died there were celebrations in Rwanda. And when they were celebrating, it was like they were proving that we, every Tutsi in Rwanda, were failing. I remember an event in Zaza, in my high school, they organized something they called “the funeral of Fred Rwigema.” I think I was in 4th grade, 3rd or 4th grade of high school, and they organized the funeral: all teachers, all faculty members, everyone who worked at the school and the students as well. They organized a march in which we participated. We went to the neighbouring hill, called Karembo, I don’t know if you know Karembo… So we went up Karembo, they had brought mats, imisambi. Traditionally in our culture, in the countryside, we bury people, the dead, we bury them wrapped in mats. And so they had these mats, they folded them and gave them to us, we had to carry them over our heads, pretending that we were going to bury Rwigema. And they gave the Tutsis—I carried a mat above my head, my friends as well, I remember, Judith, Angelique, everyone. We carried mats over our heads, they wanted to humiliate us by way of this event: “Fred, Mr. Fred is dead; and you, you are his sympathizers, you are related to him”—while we didn’t even know him. We had heard people talk about it, we didn’t know Rwigema, but they thought that—it’s like we were working—like we were his relatives. So to humiliate us, we had to carry those mats and we went to bury them in the mountain on Karembo. I remember that event. So, what I mean to say is that the genocide was prepared in advance and the uneasiness settled in very early. So from 1990 to 1994, those four years were a nightmare for every Tutsi living in Rwanda. And I lived this ordeal in high school—because I was still in high school. I also remember…—traveling to school or back home was hard. We had to take the bus and to get on the bus sometimes we had to show an ID. There were soldiers who were checking. There were roadblocks all over the country. Since 1990, there were roadblocks all over the country and to get on board, you had to show an ID. Sometimes, when they thought you were Tutsi, they would make you stand aside. If that happened, it was over, you could be imprisoned, you could be killed, anything could happen. And what did we do? My parents had warned us to hide our IDs: “Never show your ID!” So before each trip, we had to make sure that our ID was well-hidden, and place our student cards up front. When we were asked for the ID, we would say: “Oh, I forgot it at school.” Or if I was going home from school, I’d say: “Oh, I forgot it at school.” Or:  “One of my girlfriends took it. I don’t have it, but I have my student card”—and I would show my student card. The ethnicity wasn’t written on the student card, while the Tutsi ethnicity was indicated on the ID card. That’s how we manoeuvred sometimes. And sometimes they would let you go, sometimes they asked you to stand aside, and you tried to get on board another bus, so we made up these games of hide and seek with them in order to get on the bus.  These were very difficult times. Going home from school or going to school from home was difficult, and our parents were very worried—everyone was very worried. So those four years were quite a nightmare.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And so finally [inaudible]. Everything that happened in ‘94—somehow, we survived. So here we are, in ‘94, how did things unfold in your family?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Oh my god, what can I say? 1994—so I was teaching, I had finished high school in 1993, in June or July, I was at home. My little sisters and my brother were still students. Since I hadn’t passed the university admission test, I had looked for a job and I was teaching at that school, at APENYA. And in 1994, in April, it was school break, even the high school kids in Kigali or Zaza were back home. It was vacation time. So it started on April 7, or the night of April 6, the plane crashed and the country was declared in a state of high alert. So they made announcements that nobody had the right to move—we had to stay put, wherever we were. And they installed military checkpoints everywhere across the country. On every corner, on every street, on every road, there were roadblocks to control the movements of people. We were at home. When we heard the news…—for four years, we had been expecting to die, since 1990, for every Tutsi death was imminent. Death was everywhere, because there were massacres everywhere—in the Bigogwe, and everything that had happened in Bugesera, everything that had happened everywhere else, so death was imminent. And when the plane fell, we said, “It’s over. It’s going to be… It’s over!” It was clear. The message was clear: we were going to die. And in Nyarubuye, where we were, the events started a bit later, on the 15th or the 16th. People had gathered in the church. As I told you, we lived very close to the church in Nyarubuye, so we took refuge there believing that we would be saved. We prayed, we stayed there, we prayed. From time to time, they came and threw stones, but the day when they killed people was the 15th. The soldiers arrived accompanied by the interahamwe. They came with the purpose to kill, they used machetes, they used spears, they used guns, and there were a lot of people [gathered in the church]. Some were from the Nyarubuye area, but also from the surrounding areas, like Mushikiri—there is an area called Mushikiri—Kankobwa, Bwiyorere—so everybody had come to the parish, to the big church in the area to seek refuge. So on the 15th, they attacked with the support of the militia, but the interahamwe were also armed with spears, clubs, all kinds of objects they used to kill.  And I remember they even used—how do you say urusenda?",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You sneezed and in this way it showed who was still hiding, who was dying. It was terrible, what happened on the 15th and the 16th. And the survivors of this massacre were hiding all around, in the bush—the church was surrounded by eucalyptus forests—we were hiding all over that area, waiting for the help of the RPF forces because the RPF wasn’t far away. They were advancing fast because they knew people were being killed. So, it was only after the RPF’s rescue that we finally said, “Whew, we’re survivors! Now we can—” We didn’t know what had happened. At that moment, we didn’t know that we had lost our whole families; we were alone in the situation, and when we—it’s after, it’s only afterwards that we discovered that we had lost this or that person… For years and years, you would sometimes say to yourself that maybe someone else from your family has survived. I remember I spent many, many years believing that I would find others from my family alive. After the genocide, there were camps all over the country. Refugee camps inside the country, but there were also camps outside—in Tanzania, Burundi, Congo, there were camps. And in those camps, sometimes there were Tutsis—it’s true, most of the people who had taken refuge in these camps were Hutus, but sometimes Tutsis were also arriving in those camps too, they had managed to sneak in. And I always thought—for a long time I didn’t accept my situation because I was thinking that maybe in the camp in Tanzania—because we lived near the Tanzanian border—I thought maybe one of my sisters or my brother had been able to sneak in. For years and years I lived with that uncertainty. And when the camps were closed, when the refugee camps everywhere closed, that’s when I realized I didn’t have anyone left. So it took me many, many years to accept this sad reality. It took me years. I felt confused, I thought, “I’ll surely run into one of them.” I remember mostly in ‘95, ‘96, ‘97, when I would walk down the streets in Kigali, I would keep my eyes wide open, looking all around me to maybe recognize someone from my family. I believed in a miracle. So every time I listened to the radio, or when I was reading—especially when they were communicating information—to see if someone in my family had been asking for…—things like that. So I spent many years of confusion, but unfortunately, after a while I said to myself, “Oh my dear…—that’s it, you have to accept it.”",Interviewee,No Tension

I am, in my mind, trying to recreate the scene at the church in Nyarubuye. You have left, with your family, your three sisters, your brother, your mother and your father, I imagine you were all in the same place. What was your reflex when the church was attacked, when you saw the militia coming?  If I am seeing you here today and if I am talking to you now, that’s because you had the reflex to do something and you realized later that the others didn’t do the same thing perhaps—and you learned from this experience.

You are completely overcome by fear, it’s as if you’ve had an electric shock.

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"They used axes to cut down the doors, they were using whatever they could. I remember when the door was about to come down. For a long time we could hear them hacking at it, trying to remove that door that protected us, to finally get to where we were. In that moment, you’re scared stiff, you’re not thinking anymore, you’re not crying, you have no tears left in you, you’re there, you’re awaiting death. We could hear the sounds of guns outside, shots, people screaming, grown-ups, children, everyone screaming. And you are there, waiting for the door that is protecting you to open so that you can finally be killed. It’s a difficult moment. What did I do? I didn’t do anything. They opened the door, they finally—the door fell on us and we got out. And before even killing people, they first selected those who—there were some who were well-known and those were the ones they were looking for. I was lucky, because where I was—in the same way as when two days before the genocide, I had gone to visit friends and I wasn’t home when it happened. So since I wasn’t—I was in an environment where not many people knew me. When they broke into the house, they were looking for so and so’s daughter, they were looking for a specific person. They were seeking out specific individuals, and I wasn’t among them. That’s what saved me, in the end. Because I was in a place where not many people knew me. Nobody was interested in me and so I was able to sneak out. I was able to sneak out, otherwise—so I sneaked out, I got out, I went to hide in the bush. I stayed in the bush for a long time. And I remember I was wearing pants, but I had to look for some pagnes to wear because in this region pants are a sign that you are an educated person. I had to disguise myself as an old woman. And by “old woman” I mean, say, 70 or a 100 years old. So I was walking [shows curved posture]—my body was bent and I was wearing a pagne. I did what I could to disguise myself, to not show my face. So I was wearing—like a Muslim woman [makes a gesture to show covering her head], and at the same time I had to do all I could to appear like an old lady, like someone who has no life, someone of no interest to you. So that’s how I went on disguised. I didn’t eat, I wanted to drink, but I couldn’t find anything to drink. And I remember one day I was really, really thirsty. What did I do?

We could hear them moving forward. At one point, I felt surrounded by silence, no one was moving. You had to hide at all times, because people were passing by, the interahamwe were everywhere. And one day, I was surrounded by a peculiar silence, which meant that the interahamwe were gone. Two days later, I thought, “Oh my god, what—I’m the only one left in this world, how is that possible?” I couldn’t hear anything, not a thing. And I got scared. I got scared of being all alone in this world—what would I do? I thought, “My god, I have to get out of this situation.” I came out of my hiding place, I tried to get a sense of orientation, to see if I could find anyone walking, crying, a sign of human presence. So, I—while trying to get out I saw corpses everywhere, corpses everywhere I went. That’s when I saw that the inkotanyi had taken over the area. So the inkotanyi had taken over the area two or three days before, and I wasn’t aware of that, because I was hiding. The interahamwe were gone and I was there. I found—I reached the inkotanyi forces, because we recognized their uniforms, and when I saw their camp, I saw the soldiers, but I had to make sure it was them, I had to make sure that they were indeed inkotanyi soldiers and that it wasn’t the camp of the former Rwandan Armed Forces.

And the hats they wore were different from those of the Rwandan Armed Forces. And when I saw the hat of one of the inkotanyi soldiers, oh, I thought, “Am I dreaming? Is this true? Is it the inkotanyi? What is happening to me?” I felt—what I was feeling was particular. I don’t know if I can say that I felt good, but I felt a little different. I walked towards that man and he looked at me. And while I was walking forward, I yelled to all sides, “I’m not an interahamwe, I’m not an interahamwe.” Then he saw me. He wasn’t enthusiastic, he just looked at me like that and I was looking at him, I came closer, I was still wearing my disguise—",Interviewee,No Tension

At first, perhaps, he didn’t know that I was a person, because I was walking like that [shows bent position], sneaking my way forward. Then I saw him and yelled, “I’m not an interahamwe, I’m not an interahamwe.” And he saw this old lady, wearing a pagne, dressed like that from head to toe, he looked at me with a bit of a dismissive eye, and me too, I was afraid of him, because I wasn’t sure that he was an inkotanyi soldier. But he looked at me, I moved closer, and then he asked me to raise my hands [raises her hands] so that he could check that I wasn’t wearing—",Interviewee,Tension

And when he saw that I had nothing, he looked at me like I was—I was ugly for sure, many days had passed without washing, without eating, without doing anything, I was ugly, ugly.  Then he brought me to a centre where there were other people, other survivors. He gave me water to wash up, he gave me clothes to get dressed in and then he gave me something to drink. Many drinks—a whole day went by before I was able to eat. Even drinking, I only took very, very small sips. For a week I was feeling sick. And after a week, it was like I woke up. I was taking medication, because I was coughing a lot, I had headaches, I was taking many pills. And then I felt alive again, I started getting used to the life at the centre where we were. There were many of us there. We were trained, a brief training to administer drugs to people who were in a very, very bad state compared to the rest of us, so I became an on-the-spot nurse. Yes, we took care of others who had just arrived. In my case too, there were people who had taken care of me and when I was back in good shape, I began taking care of people who were in a bad state, who were very sick, who were very hungry. So we helped each other. Then what happened? Later, I said to myself, “Is there anyone left from my family?” That’s when the questioning started: “Has anyone from my family survived?” I searched everywhere, everywhere, and I didn’t find anything. I found some relatives, more or less distant relatives, and that’s all. My life began anew, thanks to the people around me, thanks to my relatives that I was able to find, including the famous grandmother Alivera who really devoted herself to me. But my life began anew, I made new friends, I went to university, even though I wasn’t sure if I really needed to go or not. But I went anyways… The period after the war was a hard one for me to deal with. It was like I’ve lost all effort to live. It was like nothing could reassure me, I saw no reason to live, I didn’t see a single reason to live, and at the same time I wasn’t ready to commit suicide—so I lived between these two states. And little by little, by meeting people, talking to people, and with the support of the relatives I still had, I was able to rebuild my life.",Interviewee,No Tension

There were also the refugees from Burundi, the Tutsis who were in Burundi, who were coming back, or those who were in Tanzania, dispersed everywhere, who were returning. And among the people who were coming back, I found my relatives, those who were living outside the country before the war.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Who had left. So I found one of my cousins, Germaine, whom I knew from before. She was—one day, we were doing—we were taking care of the people who had just arrived, giving them medication, filling in the patient registry—there was a girl from Burundi, and it was Germaine.  One day we were talking and talking, I talked about the people from my family, on my mother’s side, on the side of—we were having a conversation. The people coming back—they had just returned, they wanted—they were looking for their relatives. And those of us who had stayed in Rwanda, the survivors, we were also looking for members of our families. And we talked about that all the time. We would find any opportunity to talk about it. And she told me, “I come from Burundi, my father’s name is Rusanganwa and I had—we lived in Congo, then we went to Burundi, but I know we had a big family in Rwanda. We had a big family, I had aunts, such as Alivera, I had—” So she told me about them. And I asked her, “Which family are you from?” And she said, “I am from Rusanganwa’s family.” And I knew that Rusanganwa was the name of my mother’s uncle who lived in Burundi. I said, “Don’t tell me you’re Rusanganwa’s daughter, because I know I have an uncle, Rusanganwa, who lives in Burundi—” She said, “Oh yes? I’m his daughter!” And then we continued talking and she asked me, “Are you Théo’s niece?” And I thought, “Théo who?” She said, “Are you the niece of Théo who lives in France?” I said, “Yes, that’s my uncle.” That’s how we found each other. And then Germaine told me that aunt Alivera is alive and that she is in Kigali. While we were at the camp, we could travel with the military cars. When we were looking for—when we knew that a military car was available, going on a mission to Kigali or to Kibungo or somewhere, we would try to get a lift. We would ask them: “I need to go to Kigali to find someone—or for whatever reason,” and they gave us a ride for free because we didn’t have any money. So Germaine and I went to look for Alivera and we found Alivera. It was an emotional moment because Alivera didn’t know I was still alive, she had learned that everyone in Kageruka’s family, everyone had died. So what she knew was that no one had survived from my family. And when she saw me, she said, “Oh my god!” In Kinyarwanda she said, “Mwana wanjye, uriho!

She protected me, she gave me a lot of love because I represented all the people she had lost. And with my uncles returning from Burundi, from Uganda, I could enjoy the feeling of being loved, despite everything. I benefited from the support of all those people who understood my situation, who showed me compassion. They supported me, I didn’t really have any difficulties—no lack of affection, no financial difficulties, they were there for me. That’s it. After that I went to university; then I got married and had children, and now I’m here in Canada. That’s it. [laughter]",Interviewee,No Tension

I learned that quite quickly, but I didn’t want to accept it. So it took me a long time before I started looking for them again, because I didn’t want to accept that sad reality.  I told you earlier that when I was walking in the city—because I stayed with my aunt, my grandmother Alivera who was in Kigali, so I lived in Kigali after the genocide. I never went back to live at home, in Nyarubuye, because there was no one there. And when I was walking in Kigali, I was thinking, I kept my eyes wide open to see if I would find one of my sisters, one of my uncles. I was always looking for them. I spent several years in this situation. But, about three years later, I found the remains of some of my relatives. I found my father’s remains. I learned that the remains of my relatives were in the church itself, that their bones were there. There was nothing I could do. I could bury my father’s bones because he wasn’t in the church.

They told me where he was. I went to see these people in prison, I talked to them and they told me that they had killed him on his way to Tanzania. The place is called Rushonga, I don’t know if you know it. So they killed him there and the prisoner himself came to show us the place. We exhumed my father’s bones and brought him home to my house.

And my mother was wounded all over her body, she had wounds everywhere and I was told that she didn’t die right away, she spent several days like that, with these wounds. And finally she was—she died… just like my three sisters and my brother. They are all buried in the Nyarubuye cemetery. Only my father is buried at home, because he was apart.

I’m still living with it, but without hope that I would find anyone, because I learned how each one of them died. Now I know how. I only saw my father’s remains and I’m sure that it’s him because I saw the sweater he was wearing. It was a yellow sweater, I recognized it. Of the people I knew, he’s the only one I’ve seen, so his death is, to me, a concrete fact. I know that the others are there and, in a mysterious way, I accept their death.

I could see that they were skewing the real truth, the one they are supposed to tell me. I could see they were biased, but I couldn’t force them, I couldn’t do anything, I let them be. But I learned from them—these are people who were there, after all—they talk to you, they tell you how it happened. You can’t deny, you accept, you accept the facts as they happened. That’s it.

They all try to shrink from responsibility, they try to present themselves as witnesses: “Yes, I saw it, but it wasn’t me who did that.” Yes.

What was most difficult every time you tried to move forward?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Oh, many things. Many things because you are uprooted. It is true that I carry within me the memories of my family as a kind of a baggage, which helps me live. It gives me strength. But what was most difficult? I will tell you a little anecdote. One day I went back to my region, at home, I was with my husband. It was after we got married. When we were there, in our house, adjacent to the big house is a place where we used to play as kids. My little sisters, my brother and I, we played a lot when we were young. Every evening, after we have done our work, all the chores we had to do around the house, we gathered at that corner to play. My father liked to read in the evenings so we couldn’t play near him. We had to find a place where we can be free, do whatever we wanted without disturbing anyone. So when I went back to my region, to my home, with my husband, we could see the state of the place: brushes sprouting, grass growing wild, trees overgrowing the site. And then I found myself in that same corner of the house, and memories started coming back to me rapidly, and I was asking my husband, “Oh, do you remember, do you remember…” I was telling him stories, spontaneously like that, and he was silent. And I was waiting for a reaction from him because I thought I was recounting this memory to someone who had been there, who shared this memory with me. I looked at him with—I was surprised that he wasn’t reacting, that he wasn’t saying anything. And I turned to him and I realized that he was my husband, that he had nothing to do with all that. And I thought, “Oh my god!” And after I told him that, he said, “Oh, I understand, I’m sorry!” So I mean to tell you how difficult it is. It’s difficult. It’s like your life has been cut off somewhere. The most difficult thing is not to have a sister or a brother with whom you’ve made this journey together and with whom you can reminisce, you can talk to—that’s even worse. So I keep many, many memories, I have no one to share them with. That’s even worse. At least if I had a sister, if I had a brother, at least one, I could tell them: “Do you remember what my father used to say, what my mother used to say, what my sister used to do…?” Things like that. But you have no one. So you keep—you’re forced to keep it all inside. It’s hard.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Or you’re talking to someone who doesn’t have the same memories…,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"The same memories, the same sense of gravity of the situation, the same consideration, all that. Yes, you tell your story, you tell your story or you leave it unspoken, it’s as you wish. Another difficult thing is when you’re trying to rebuild your life and when you have children. When you have to explain [to them]. When you have to explain what happened—again, that’s most difficult. It’s true, I have a family, but my children—when I was still in Rwanda, we often went to visit the grandparents, the grandparents on their dad’s side. So they played with them, they knew them, they socialized with them. And then I realized that when he got to a certain age, my son thought I was their father’s sister. Because he never—he visited my family, at aunt Alivera’s house, but he knew that aunt Alivera is not my mother. So, I thought, maybe he’s wondering: “Who is my mother’s mother?” He was seeing their father’s biological mother and he thought that I’m their father’s sister. So I had to explain that. When you’re living these kind of realities that are difficult for you to accept, it’s even worse having to pass them on to your children. But that’s how it is. We try—all we can do is to try to explain, to talk to them, gently. That’s it.",Interviewee,No Tension

They know that there was genocide in Rwanda, but when it comes to the Hutu-Tutsi realities, they don’t know anything about that. When we were in Rwanda, we were watching a film about the genocide and I usually wouldn’t let them watch such films, but I don’t know how it happened that day, I was a little distracted, I realized that we saw the whole film with the children sitting next to us—I don’t know how it happened. And later my son told me—like two days later, he said, “Mom, why were those people killing the others?” And then he said, “Where was President Kagame?” And so I had to tell the history of the RPF, the history of the realities inside the country. He was, like, 7 years old, it was hard to explain. I tried to tell him briefly that there was a genocide in the country, that President Kagame wasn’t president yet, that at the time he was fighting those killers, that he wasn’t yet in a position to see things happening and that he became president later, after he was able to save people, etc. So it’s this kind of reality that we’re confronted with every day.

It is very difficult, but at the same time, it is this [inaudible] that contributes to the reconstruction of the individual, of his personality, because we need the other. That’s the realization I came to afterwards. When I went back to university I was with one of my friends from before, her name is Rénette. She’s a friend of mine, she knew my family. She is someone very precious to me. So when I went to university, she was the only one I knew there. And then, little by little, we made friends. I made friends with people from my classes, and her as well, she made friends with people from her classes. And since I was her friend, I met her friends and she met mine. And over the years, our network grew. We don’t realize it, but it happens quickly: you are together in university, you have similar educational goals, you start by talking to each other about your courses, you help each other succeed and then a friendship settles. We met people from Burundi, young people from Uganda, Tanzania, all over the Great Lakes region. Families with children were returning [to Rwanda] and these children went to university. With time, we made new friends; some discovered family members there, at the university. That part wasn’t difficult, it wasn’t really all that difficult.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It wasn’t that easy, because we were behaving differently. There was, first of all, the community of young people who had stayed in Rwanda, who were the survivors, and together, we got along very well. We understood each other very well. But there was also the fact that there were people who had just come back, they used to be students back where they lived, but had to interrupt their studies because their parents had decided to return to Rwanda. So we ended up in this mixed company where everyone had different habits, depending on which country they came from. But by the end of the year, or at a certain point in time, there was a happy medium. A happy medium was established and all of us, we coexisted very well. Yes. Although certainly the beginning wasn’t easy. There was mistrust. We, the people who had stayed in the country, were accused of being too quiet. Those who were coming back were saying, “Oh, those sope”—we were called sope, sopecya—“why don’t these sopes like to talk? They are always withdrawn, they don’t communicate, they don’t speak proper French.” Things like that, small criticisms like that.

Whether it’s survivors, like me or others, whether it’s people from these other groups, it’s on a case-by-case basis. Some people were open, there were some Hutus even who were open, who were sensible to our problems, with whom we collaborated, with whom we felt in good company. And there were people from abroad who were good too—it depends. It depends on the person. I think it’s difficult to make generalizations about this kind of relationships. It’s very personal. It depends on the two people meeting each other, it depends on their disposition, it depends on their habits.

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Yes. The university reopened in 1995.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,A year later…,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"A year later. That’s when—it was in April or March, something like that—that’s when the university doors were opened again. And it was special. Why? There was our group, the people who had stayed in Rwanda, who had failed, failed, failed [the exam]—me and the others. And there were also the people who had just returned to the country, who had interrupted their studies or others who were just beginning—so you had to be able to manage all that. What did they do? How did they proceed? They proceeded by organizing tests for each faculty, depending on your choice of program. I had chosen to go into the humanities. So we were grouped together, the people who had selected that option, we were grouped together, we passed a test, I passed the test, I got the letter of acceptance and I started, like the others. So they organized an admission test at the same time for everyone. Because we didn’t even have papers, imagine. I didn’t have my high school diploma with me, because it was still at the École normale primaire in Zaza. I hadn’t picked it up yet. We had to pass a test to be evaluated. So they were really very flexible, very understanding, under these circumstances.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"[You were] a survivor, a child, I’m not going to say “alone” because you had found a grandmother. Who contributed to your studies?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Oh, my uncles. And I also received a bursary and a student loan. The Ministry of Education—at the beginning of the year you signed a contract with the ministry that you were given a bursary at the end of each month and with this bursary you could manage your simple life. For sure, it was easier for those who had a family or friends. Me, for example, I tried to budget my bursary well, but when I was short on money and if I wanted to buy nice shoes, if I wanted to do my hair, if I wanted to be like a young lady, I had to ask my uncles. And they contributed, they helped a lot with my studies. But otherwise the bursary was only relatively sufficient. You could manage, maybe not lead a good life, but you could buy school supplies, food—we ate at the university, it was cheap on campus. With the bursary, it was manageable.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,And how long was your program at the university?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Four years. From 1995 to 1999. That’s when I finished university. But I think I defended my thesis in 2000, I remember I was a little late. It was in 2000 that I finished everything.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,So you did a Master’s degree?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"In Butare, that’s a BA in Humanities. And I majored in History. So I studied History—and what did I do after that? I got married.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Ah!,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, I got married while at the university, when I was in my third year—no, my fourth year—my last year of university I got married. I got married in 1998, a year before the end of my studies. So I started a family.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Where did you meet your husband?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Where did I meet him? Through an acquaintance, while visiting a family we both knew, because he didn’t study at my university. He studied at Makelele University in Uganda, but we met during a visit to the family of a mutual friend of ours. That’s where we met and then we continued seeing each other [laughter]… But the starting point was that family.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And so you found yourself working again—for the second time, I think. Did you work after you finished your studies or during? How did you get back into the workforce?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So at that point I was married, I had a child. I had a normal life: someone who had just finished school, who had a family, who was responsible for her child, for her little home. I couldn’t wait to start working, to contribute to the development of my family. It wasn’t difficult. You follow the job offers and if you are selected for a position you pass an interview or a written or an oral test, it depends. If you are accepted—great. I had the chance to work at the KIST, the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology. They had a library and since I had studied history, I loved the book industry, I loved working with books and with the students. I was hired at that university as a librarian. I worked there for seven years. From 2000, towards the end of 2000, I started working at KIST as a librarian and in 2003 I started a Master’s degree in the field of library and information sciences. I came back to work in 2004, towards the end of 2004, and I continued working there as a librarian. Then in 2007 I changed positions and I started working at the Rwanda Information Technology Authority (RITA). It is an agency that deals with information technology in the country. I started working there. I worked there for two months, after which I came to Canada… [laughter]",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,So as soon as you started out in the field you left?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, that’s it.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Before I ask you about Canada—I asked you this about your parents, I’m going to ask you the same questions about yourself. You said that at a certain moment you became a wife, a mother, a civil servant. How did you manage to reconcile the three? You are a mother, you are a wife, you have to work—how did you feel about all this? How did you manage to reconcile it all?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It is hard to respond to the call of this triple duty, so to speak. It’s very hard, but fortunately, in Rwanda, you have your family, you have people nearby who advise you, who help you. But there is also a system of domestics. You hire a domestic who comes, who lives in your house, you give her a salary at the end of the month, and she takes care of your children when you aren’t there; you can hire a boy [a young male servant] as well. And all you have to do is supervise them. You have two people at home that you pay to help you and you do the supervision. Sure, it’s hard; not having enough time for my children was hard for me. I was split between the obligations of work and social obligations, and I think I wasn’t doing enough especially for my children, because of lack of time. I worked from 8 to 5. So my kids—it’s true, the little one was at home all the time with the domestics in my absence and when I would come home, I was tired. If you come home tired, taking care of the children, taking care of the life of your family, sometimes seeing friends and extended family, you are divided between all that, it’s not easy to manage. But that’s the system, that’s the way of life. We try, we try to do our best as much as we can.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You told us that you worked at RITA and then after two months you left. We’re now having this conversation here in Montreal. I’m asking myself, or asking you rather—it seems like things are going well for you.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Ah! Thank you.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Why? Why did you leave? What prompted you to leave?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"What prompted me to leave? There are, I would say, two reasons. We had a history professor who would say that for an event to take place there are immediate causes and there are also distant causes. A whole complex set of factors contributes to the realization of any event. [We left] for medical reasons concerning my son. But also as a survivor, I always had within me, I always kept deep inside those horrible memories of the events I had lived through and I didn’t want to—it’s not that I was afraid, it’s not that I didn’t have confidence, but I didn’t want one of my offspring to relive that one day: twenty years later, fifty years later… I don’t know. I wanted to offer other choices in the life of my children and my offspring—from my position as the only survivor in my family. It was something within me—deep, deep within—and something that I wanted to make happen. That’s it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So at a certain point you said to yourself, “I wouldn’t want to see this happening again. For the well-being of my family and of my descendants— [inaudible] to leave…”",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It’s true that everything was going well in Rwanda, I didn’t have any problems, I was advancing well, I had a family. But there was always something eating away at my heart and telling me: “Chantal, you were able to survive, you are the only survivor, if ever one of your grandchildren, one of your great-grandchildren goes through that again, what was it all worth?” And… well, that was my main thought. So it was a way to offer something different to my offspring: other choices in life, another country. Rwanda is our country and they are entitled to their country, but having another one too—so they can decide in the future where to live.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,And your husband? Did he agree with this decision?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, of course. He did, yes.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So you were convinced that you had to leave, even though you have made a good life there for yourself—was there anything that was difficult, that was holding you back? What was the hardest part? You had your reasons for leaving, but all the same, were there any reasons not to go?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes. Yes, as I said, I needed medical care for my son. We were constantly going to South Africa for tests or to consult doctors, it was hard. And here, I knew that the means—in Rwanda the health system wasn’t really up to meeting my needs. So I thought, “I’m going to go.” It was a direct need and I had to act immediately. And on this my husband and I, we understood each other well. And that was a big motivation. Your child’s life is important. That really contributed to our decision.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,And why did you choose Canada? Did you know people here? Did you have acquaintances?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"No. How did I choose Canada? I don’t know. Oh, yes, I have a sister-in-law who lives in England, she has a family here, she has friends here who would always tell her that Canada is a good country. So when I spoke with my sister-in-law—at first I dreamed of going to France because I had lived there for a year, a year and a half. I had also visited Great Britain and loved it. I was torn between France and Great Britain. But she knew, she had come to Canada to visit her family who lived here. She told me that she likes—that she loves Canada. And I wanted to discover this country she was telling me about. [laughter] Yes, I wanted to discover Canada and that’s how I came here. So I came to Canada on someone’s advice.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So you were convinced [you wanted to go], you left, you came to Canada with your three children. What did you do then? Where does one start in a situation like that?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"During the first days, everything was a surprise. You are surprised by everything you’re experiencing. You give up all your well-built life, you start again. It’s an adventure. You start something that you don’t even know will succeed. You feel remorse during the first days, you say to yourself: “Oh my god, can I do this?” It’s hard to manage, it’s stressful getting used to this, to doing so many things all at once. When we were in Rwanda, there were many of us: my husband was there to help me, the domestics, all our friends were there as well, there was a whole sociocultural group there, a whole structure, which is always behind you for support and encouragement. And here I found myself all alone, with my three children and I had to face life and at the same time I didn’t have the right not to face it—there is a force pushing you forward, you can’t give up. It’s a great effort, it’s hard. It was a difficult period, 2007–2008 was a difficult period for me. The winter—I’ve never known a winter like that. I’ve seen winter in France, but that was like spring or autumn here. And here, I found that the winter is very hard and very painful and very difficult. So you have to adapt, you have to find extra effort to make life work. So I found myself in this situation, and I was a fighter. I engaged in this fight and I am still in it.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And especially that you didn’t know anyone here, right?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Right, I didn’t know anyone. I met people thanks to the Rwandan social networks: someone who lives in Calgary and who says to you, “Oh, you know, I have a friend who’s there, her name is Carole, or her name is Monique, I’ll put you in touch.” Okay, step by step. After a while I started discovering other connections, like two friends from university, Suzanne and Diane, who were here at the Université de Montréal. In the beginning—but later I began discovering that there were, around here, people I know. When I first arrived, I didn’t know they were here, but little by little, I discovered that. And it makes you feel better.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I understand that you’ve discovered, I won’t say easily, but perhaps quickly, the Rwandan network. But did you use any specific services in Canada?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes. Community associations, like CARI in the City of Saint-Laurent, or CACI in the Cartierville neighbourhood. I consulted these two organizations, they give me a whole range of information, they helped me, they organized appointments with such and such specialist or with such and such social worker. It’s good. And when you have—I remember one social worker at the CARI, her name was Chantal, same as me, we—every time I had a problem I called her: “Chantal, I need this, where should I go?” Or I’d call Monique or—for the moment, things are okay. I—whether through the Rwandan network or through these community organizations, I can function.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Two and a half.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Two and a half years. Did you discover, through the network, activities that relate to Rwanda, that you can join in, that are of interest to you, where you can continue to—the culture, traditions and the conversations? Have you discovered these things?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, I discovered the Community-University Research Alliance project [CURA], and this same project—I found Rwandans who are involved in this project and it’s as if, in this way, I continue to contribute to the Rwandan cause. CURA is the only one such activity, but I’m happy with what it’s brought to my life. The way of doing things, the way of collaborating, the topics that are discussed, I think it’s good, for me it’s a way to stay connected to all that can contribute to the development of my country, even from a distance.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I’m wondering now if, when you get together with Rwandans in Montreal, sometimes when you talk about Rwanda—before, when we were talking about Rwanda and about going back to university, I asked you, “When you were with your friends, how did you rebuild your life? What did you talk about with your friends?” Now in Montreal, when you meet other Rwandans, do you talk about Montreal? Or are you still mentally in Rwanda?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Of course, Rwanda is the starting point before we found ourselves here! [laughter] We reminisce about our country and we try to find out if, by chance, we know the same people. For example, where did I meet Monique? At university in Rwanda and so we talk about past events back there. We try to get to know each other through these past events. In Montreal, yes, we talk about things that relate to Montreal, we try to adapt, we try to integrate better. Yes, and I ask questions: “How do we find jobs? Where can we bring our children to play?” Yes, in Montreal, we talk about that too. In fact, it’s like being split between the two. It’s good to talk about Rwanda, but we also need to talk about Montreal because this is where we live now and we need to talk about it.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Precisely, you just said that you ask questions, you need information. What has your journey been like since you’ve come here? How would you describe your journey?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"What have I done since I’ve arrived? The most important thing for me was to integrate the children because it was an abrupt change for them, they left their relatives behind, their friends, and they find themselves here, with their mom, all alone. So I tried to give some structure in their lives, to be available for them as much as possible; to accompany them everywhere. So, the first two years, I think, I was much more dedicated to the integration of my children, to be there for them. So, I haven’t started working full-time yet. But I’m thinking about it, I’m thinking about it. I dream of going back to work one day.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,One cannot escape from one’s personal experience. How does your experience as a genocide survivor affect your life here in Montreal?,Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You are a survivor of the genocide, you have lived through that. Being here, do you think your life in Montreal is like that of anyone else’s, anyone coming from any other country? Or do you find that your personal experience influences your life here?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Oh, I understand. Yes, I think my experience played a role in my integration here. Why? Because after the genocide, I found myself alone, I had to continue living. And after leaving everyone in my country, here again I find myself alone. It’s true, [in Rwanda] I had rebuilt a family and social life that were working for me, and here I have to start again from zero. I have to find friends, I have to do everything. So yes, that experience helped me a lot. It’s as if this painful past—had you accepted to live through it—it’s as if you develop internal mechanisms of patience, of understanding. There are certain mechanisms that you develop to be able to adapt and they help you wherever you are, especially patience and understanding. I remain patient, I remain understanding of everything that is happening, all the while I also remain determined to achieve my goals. All of these are things that I draw from my past, from my experience.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,…that you are drawing on...,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes… all that, it is within me, it helps me still.

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,Do you have the impression that the people of Montreal or Canada are looking at you differently when they learn that you are a genocide survivor?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I don’t think so. I don’t meet that many people, but I think that people here in Montreal are sensitive to everything that has happened in Rwanda—the people I meet, at least. They are sensitive, they know, in one way or another, that there was a genocide in Rwanda, and they know that there are people who have lived through this genocide and who are still there, who remember. Yes, they are understanding, I think they are understanding, at least the people that I meet. They are not ignorant about this issue and neither—yes, I find them sympathetic to this issue.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Let me go back a bit. We talked about the contribution, the support, so very important, that you have received from your family, but is there a flip side: do you sometimes tell to yourself, “I would have liked to have that support from my family now, or from the Rwandan community; but I don’t have it”?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It’s hard, it’s hard to explain. Personally, I appreciate what the people around me have done for me. If I am here now, I owe it to many, many people who have helped me, who have been understanding, who have talked to me, who have given me advice, who have been there for me. Whether it’s members of my family, whether it’s friends, whether it’s people that I meet every day, I appreciate it, I appreciate them, and I have no regrets. On the contrary, I feel appreciation for this entire network of people. I appreciate them and I am grateful to them, I thank them.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"We talked about many things and, as I said earlier—and I could be wrong—but it seems to me that you are doing okay. I cannot not ask you this question: Given your journey, if things are working out, if it seems that they are working out, do you, Chantal, have your own personal strategies that keep you going, that help you move forward?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I do, for sure. The first strategy is what? It’s the strength I get from my family. And after losing my family, I have given myself a guiding principle or, rather, a responsibility: my life… I live it for them. They are not here anymore, but I live for them. Everything I do, all my successes, everything I do, I do it in the name of my parents, my sisters, my brother.  So that’s something that I have developed and that gives me strength. I can’t give up because of them—if I give up, it’s like I give up on them. If I work and I succeed, they are happy. It’s as if they are there, in my imagination, I am with them. They live with me always and when I accomplish something good, it’s for them, and that encourages me. Because of that, I can never give up the fight. That’s my first strategy. And what else? I say to myself: “There is a reason why I am here, why I am alive, so I have to live, I have to live.” But above all, the first strategy—that’s where my strength lies.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I know you haven’t gone back to Rwanda yet, or you don’t have time yet to go for a visit, but later on, do you see yourself returning, either from time to time or even permanently to Rwanda?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, of course. I have family there, I have a grandmother, Alivera, who calls me all the time, who sometimes says to me: “Chantal, I’m going to die without seeing you again,” and it hurts me very much to hear that. When she’s sick, she calls me, or she asks my husband to call me, my husband goes to her house and they call me together. And when she calls me, the first thing she says is: “Chantal, I’m slowly losing my strength, I’m advancing in age, I don’t want to die without seeing you again.” It hurts me deeply hearing that. So this is to say how much I am looking forward to going back to my country. I want to go back for many, many reasons: family, friends, I miss the whole Rwandan sociocultural context. Here we try to recreate this context, but we will never succeed. I feel that we can’t do it. So I miss the experience of being there, that way of life. The moment the opportunity presents itself, I will go back.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I’m going to ask you this anyway, even though you kind of answered my question: What do you miss the most? [laughter]",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"From Rwanda? Oh my god, what do I miss the most? I miss everything. [laughter] The way of life, the way people behave, our culture, the way of communicating, the social aspect. What do I mean by “social aspect”? I mean friends, family, get-togethers, calling people regularly on the phone, socializing. Rwandan way of life is entirely connected with and inseparable from being social. So I miss the warmth in interpersonal relations, the whole atmosphere. Even if we try to recreate the same thing here, we can’t do it. We have a very special way of life, very beautiful, very admirable, we can’t replicate that here. So I miss all that. The people, seeing the people, admiring the people, that’s it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes. I’m going to tell you something. There are things—I don’t know if it’s a strategy or an instinct, but when I feel that something is destructive for me, I put it aside. Many, many questions remain unanswered for me. I avoid placing them front and centre, but I keep them somewhere within. Maybe one day I will have the time, I will have the solution, but if I don’t immediately have the solution to something, I frame it somewhere at the back of my mind; I avoid it. Yes, I avoid it, there are things that I avoid.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Well, there are some things that you avoid and that you don’t—if you can’t avoid certain things, you will never be able to move forward. I spent many years without—without ambition… The first years were very painful for me, and that’s how I learned that there is—if I’m on this earth—when I made a choice to remain alive, that’s when I realized there are some things I have to put aside. Since I can’t find solutions, why continue thinking about it. So I live with it, but it’s as if I have created a page on which I’m constantly writing these things down. The page is long, I don’t know how many pages there are, but I keep them and I continue. I try to differentiate the things that can break me, I write them down on that page and I continue on.",Interviewee,Tension

There are many trends, several hypotheses—it has been interpreted—how can I say… Every person has their own interpretation. Every person—if they want to make a comedy out of it, if they want to talk about what really happened, if they want to play politics, it’s been interpreted accordingly. Everyone in their own way. Everyone in their own way, but it’s unfortunate, when you see the people who, at the cost of the blood of a million people and even more—I don’t think there has been for the moment an exhaustive identification of the victims of the genocide—so I find it regrettable that people dare turning it into anything they personally want at the cost of all those who died. I find that unfortunate.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"No—the movie, yes. When you want to communicate, the film—well, it depends on how you make this film. It depends on the message you want the audience to hear. If you want them to hear—the problem is not the film, it’s not the book, it’s not the show about the genocide. The problem is: what comes out of it. How do you interpret, what do you want people to understand? If you want people to understand that there was a genocide in Rwanda, that the Tutsis were killed and how, and so on in a similar logic, then everything is fine.  But if you want to prove the opposite, that’s what I detest. But if all media contributed to the search for the truth that we are still looking for, that would be better. We would like all media to help us to understand the truth surrounding the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. We would like—if the whole world could collaborate for this cause!",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I would tell them to be thorough and to be on the ground. To document things, to document the facts at the very least. Facts are complicated, but nevertheless they should contact the survivors, because it is the survivors who know the truth. Instead of reading a book, relying on a book you’ve read, relying on a movie you’ve seen, try to consult with people: meet with them, talk to them, this is where you will find out what happened. Otherwise, the media—it’s true, some media outlets try to talk about things objectively, but not all of them do that. Not all the media. What I would like is this: that every opportunity be used to tell the truth of what really happened, instead of talking around the genocide—and what happened was a genocide—instead of surrounding this reality with other things for various reasons, I would like for the truth to come out. So that we can finally live! Otherwise, ours is not a life, we are constantly frustrated and confronted with things that make us angry, and that’s not good.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I think that both are necessary: it’s true that the survivors have lived through this reality and they can speak from the heart, but we also need the expertise of the other. The other’s observation, the interpretation of the other. The two together can make something good. Because when something happens to us, sometimes it’s—we stay immersed in it. The fact that—it’s difficult to maintain a distance from that and to say—it’s difficult to communicate in an objective and scientific manner, so to speak. To make—it’s hard to step back from that, and to tell the story of it. We try, but it’s not always easy. There are many factors at play, emotions—there are many, many things that can have an impact, while if the two are combined, they can create something good, accurate, objective. I would say that we need the experience and the expertise of others.",Interviewee,Tension

I am—I don’t have enough power, but I know that I have this idea within me to ​​make others discover what has happened to us. I feel a sense of responsibility to defend our cause.  So anything that can help to communicate, to understand, because we’re trying to—there are misconceptions out there, sometimes we think that you have understood, but that’s not the case. So if I can help others understand, to explain to them—that’s why, by the way, I accepted to do this interview. I thought that if in some way my interview, my story can help people understand what happened in Rwanda in 1994, why not! That’s why I immediately said yes when you contacted me for this project. That’s what motivates me always: to be able to explain and at the same time to understand and also help others understand, to communicate. It’s this search that is within me, these misconceptions that I seek to address, so why not! Yes. It’s possible.",Interviewee,Tension

In a more general way, I would say to the whole world to see us as people who have suffered and who sometimes continue to suffer, who struggle to keep on living and to understand what has happened. Because sometimes we find that people don’t understand, they don’t grasp the true meaning of what has happened. I can tell them that we are here to explain, they can contact us at any time, it would be our pleasure to share our experience with them. Because, personally, I wouldn’t want what happened to me to happen to anyone else, whether it is a Montrealer, a Canadian, a person from France or from England. I would never wish that what happened to me happens to someone else. So I wish we could fight, this is a fight in which everyone can participate, a fight for a better world, a world where children can grow up next to their parents, where parents can enjoy life with their children and their grandchildren, where someone who is sick can benefit from the help of his daughter, his daughter-in-law…, to make of this world a better place.

ENTREVUE AVEC MARIE CHANTAL KAGERUKA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, I was talking about the campus, our experience as students, and being together as survivors, to test what we have learned. And what did help me there? Before, I thought I was a survivor who has been through the worst in the world. I thought of myself as being special, and alone in this situation. And when I arrived at the university and met others there, I knew, I could see that I wasn’t the only one. I met other young people of my age who had the same problems as me, and I thought, “Oh, I’m not the only one.” That was a very important and powerful factor for me. To find each other, we lived together, we shared, we lent clothes to each other, we gave each other soap, we gave each other skin cream, since the bursaries we had weren’t enough, we teamed up in order to be able to finish our studies. And I said to myself, “Oh, I had thought I was the most miserable person in the world and now I see that there are others, as unhappy and unfortunate as myself. So what do I have to say? I’m not exceptional!” So that was something. And sometimes you find that there is—I’m a survivor, I lost everything but I still have my head on my shoulders, I haven’t lost my hand, arm or leg. There were people there with physical scars—so what am I going to say? Nothing. All of this shows that together—sharing, talking, meeting others—can be very, very constructive.

I never understood what they found beautiful about Rwanda.

It must be said that—to briefly summarize my story—the Rwandan tradition is—and I think that’s still the case [makes an expression of doubt], maybe less today, but in my day this was common—I didn’t grow up in my parents’ house. I was raised in my grandparents’ house. My grandmother was a widow and according to the custom, her children, especially the girls, sent one of their children to grandma’s to help with her work. It’s a way of supporting an elderly mother who is alone, with no one to help, by having someone there helping with her household chores. My mother was very attached to her mom, so she sent me to live there. But there are other, more complex, circumstances that motivated my mother to send me to my grandma's house. It's a very long story [smiles]. Let's just say that I grew up in my grandmother's house and I know better the neighbours on my maternal side of the family than on the paternal side where I didn’t really live. I spent my whole childhood with my maternal grandmother until I started high school, which was a boarding school, and later left the country.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,What are your memories of your parents?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I have very good memories of my parents. First of all, my mother was a brilliant, intelligent woman who regretted not having studied because she could have been very successful at it. I remember, when I started living with my parents when I was 14–15 years old, my mother would wake up every morning, she would take her Bible and would read a passage from the Bible to me. Often she read the same passages. Later, when I got older, I wondered if my mother knew these passages by heart [smiles]. It was before she lost her sight—because later she lost her sight. Of course, she was glad to show me that she could read. She was very proud of that, especially because she lived in a region where everyone was illiterate. My father was illiterate, my father never went to school, he couldn’t read and when my mother read the Bible, my father would sit next to her quietly, listening. It was a moment of meditation, which started very early in the morning. Other memories—I’m the eldest child in the family. So I told you that I was raised at my grandmother's house. From what my mother has told me, I know she had a very tense relationship, a very conflictual relationship with her mother-in-law, my father's mother, and with her sisters-in-law, her brothers-in-law, and she was afraid that they would poison me, or put a curse on me. Because of the conflicts, she didn’t trust them. So she decided, in agreement with my father, to send me to live with my maternal grandmother. After that, more children came—two brothers and two sisters. They all died very young, which reinforced my mother's belief that they were poisoned by her in-laws. My mother believed this, and my father believed it too. So living at my grandparents’ was like being in a safe place. Keeping me safe, away from the enemies. It’s terrible when the enemies are close family members and not strangers. And, as we will see later when we talk about the genocide, sometimes the people closest to you can be the most dangerous. And so the fact that up to the age of 14–15 I was like an only child—because my siblings who followed me at my grandparents’ all died—my father and mother described themselves as incike, parents who have lost all their children. So much so that since I had been living with my grandmother’s from a very young age, my grandparents and my uncles and aunts on my father's side had completely forgotten me. They knew that my parents had children, that all the children had died, and the oldest child who had moved away when he was only a few months old—they had completely forgotten my existence. So to them I didn’t exist because I didn’t set foot in my parents' home until I was 13–14 years old and when I was...—because I always wanted to go there, I said I wanted to see where my parents lived, but my mother didn’t want me to, my grandmother didn’t want me to either. So when I went there for the first time, people were asking my mother, “But who is this child? He looks a lot like you.” My mother would say, “That’s my little brother,” and people believed that. They thought that I actually was my mother’s little brother. My mother still felt deep attachment. I understood later, especially as I was studying psychology, the extent of her emotional investment in me, as I was considered an only child without actually being one. To my mother, I was a precious child. Nothing could happen to me, so in a sense, I was overprotected. Often the...—people say, “I don’t get along well with my parents.” That’s not my case. I was coddled, excessively loved by my parents because I had this special status. As for my father, I would say that I had a very good relationship with my father. He respected me a lot, loved me very much, probably again for this reason—when you have an only child in a country where having many children is considered good fortune, that child becomes precious. It's not the same as when you have five, six children, ten children. I was surrounded by neighbours where the families had dozens of children, while in my case, it was only me. So this has special meaning for the child and for the parents. I remember that often when my father wanted to talk to me, to give me advice—like many young people I would go out to play and would come back very late and I didn’t see the sunset, for example at 5:30-5:45 in the evening, I could still see the sun, the weather was good, I continued to play, but I was five, six kilometers away from the house and at 6 o'clock the sun would go down, 15 minutes later, it was total darkness. I would come home around 7 o'clock and my parents would be furious, they were afraid, and my father would say: “My friend, I want to tell you something.” When my father wanted to talk to me, he would always say “my friend.” And I would think to myself, “My god, I see the other dads being rude to their children, they scold them, they insult them, they hit them, while I have all this attention.” I was really ... it’s not that I felt coddled, but I was puzzled by this. The other children were telling me how tough their parents were with them, the ... [inaudible] they hit them, while I was thinking, “Why aren’t my parents hitting me? Why isn’t my father tough with me?” So I wondered about that. My dad was really ... I had a very special relationship with him. And for many other reasons, I respected him a lot. He passed on to me many important values.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"These are very good memories of your parents. What I retain in particular from what you’re saying is that your mother was a brilliant woman and [inaudible] and that your dad was someone who listened, who knew how to listen well and who called you “my friend,” who treated you as a friend rather than a son. I imagine that this relationship gave you something very important in your life—education, training—that it was something very positive?",Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Tell me about your school. How did it go, starting primary school?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It went really well. Primary school, high school ... I liked going to school, I was learning quite easily, it never required too much effort and I really liked school. The only bad memories I have from school are the holidays and vacations. I didn’t like holidays, I didn’t like vacations. I wanted to stay at school all the time. Maybe it was because during the holidays I had to do work around the house and in the field, and I didn’t like that. I liked studying. And my mother understood that very quickly. She realized that they shouldn’t expect much from me when it comes to skills for labour, like what the other children were doing—working in the fields, building the house, things like that. While my father pushed me to be a little bit more resourceful like the others, my mother said, “Leave my child alone.” So, often, when I went herding the cows, I would bring books with me. I would read—I loved reading when I was young. I started reading fairly early. Of course the other children, the other shepherds who saw me herding the cows and reading—sometimes the cows wandered off to other people’s properties, other people’s harvests because I was so absorbed by what I was reading. So the neighbours weren’t happy. But I was a weird kid. My father was a bit puzzled by this, but my mother’s attitude was like, “He’s an intellectual, let’s leave him alone.” But I liked school a lot, same thing for high school. I went to the Groupe Scolaire secondary school in Butare, which at the time was one of the best, if not the best, school in the country. I succeeded brilliantly. I was never the best student in the class. Far from it, I never had the ambition to be the best student. I just loved school. The teachers were teaching, I was learning, and time went on. I never did homework. I absorbed the material and I did the exams, I passed them without a problem. But my ambition has never been to be the top of my class. Not at all.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I did indeed have very good relationship with my teachers. Especially in high school. I don’t remember much about elementary school where classes were large and the kids were almost at the same level. But in high school, I noticed that the Brothers liked me very much, they loved me very much, which made many of my classmates jealous—they thought I was the Brothers’ favourite. But it’s true that the Brothers liked me very much, I had a special relationship with them.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,And after high school?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"After high school ... A little anecdote here: I'm a psychologist and this vocation manifested itself for me quite early and by chance. There was a Dominican-Canadian Brother who taught at the National University of Rwanda and he came to give a lecture in my class ... I think I was in my second or third year of high school. His lecture was on personality typologies, personality types. I was fascinated by his lecture and I said to myself, “One day I will study psychology.” Another anecdote: a few years earlier, maybe five-six years earlier, I was in second or third grade and our teacher had a younger brother who was studying in Leuven and his younger brother came to visit us in the classroom. I don’t remember what he told us, but I do remember him saying that he was studying in Leuven. I was probably 9 or 10 years old at the time. And I was looking at him—he was handsome, he was wearing a nice hat, he was well-dressed and in my fantasies of a young child I thought, “I too would like to go study in Leuven one day.” And when I finished high school, I went to study in Leuven. It's really  a combination of circumstances that an old dream finally came true. At the time you could get a scholarship to study abroad if you had good grades, but, obviously, many students had good grades. I was one of them. I had good grades, and when the time came to award scholarships, I didn’t get one. I was sad because people who had worse academic record than mine were able to go; I was desperate. One of my cousins was married to the minister of education at the time. I went to see her, I begged, I said, “Could you ask your husband if I could have even a small chance to get a grant to go abroad?” She told her husband about it, and at the time the Rwandan government offered grants to some students. In any case, that year, Rwanda had sent a lot of students to Belgium, about 30 students, I think. They put me on the list. Many of the students came from the Gitarama region, that’s where the former president was from. The majority of students came from that area—and that minister, by the way, was from the same area. But because I was lucky enough to know the minister’s wife, I was one of the few students from another prefecture, Gikongoro, who left for Belgium. So it happened really by chance and a combination of circumstances, as it often happens in life.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You were lucky, then. Did you leave right after high school or did you first start university and then left?",Interviewer,-

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,Yes.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Tell us a little bit about your friends when you were in high school and what was happening at that time. So you were at school and during the holidays, as you were saying, you went back home. Did you have to work to be able to afford food? Or were you helping your parents? What was happening at that time?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"In high school, the tuition fees, called minerval—I would say they were relatively expensive for poor families because many young people didn’t have enough money to pay the minerval and they ended up not going to school, they dropped out because of that. So when I successfully completed elementary school, or rather, when I passed the exam to get into high school—I remember at the time one percent of students could go to high school. So I was among that one percent who could go to high school. My father ...—I can explain this later—my father wasn’t at home. He had gone to Uganda as a seasonal worker. In fact, what I realized afterwards was that when my father and my mother had a fight—she was strong-headed, she was very intelligent, she was domineering, she came from a very rich family, she was used to comfort, she had a great deal of self-esteem, so she was really domineering. My father, on the other hand, came from a modest family and he was very peaceful, he didn’t like drama, conflicts, so when my mother was fighting with him, he absolutely didn’t want to argue. He would leave. He would say that he was going to work to make some money—because at the time a lot of people went to Uganda—but he wasn’t really working, he would just travel around. He would make some money and then he would go travelling and when he returned home, he would tell me about his trips. He had travelled all of East Africa, up to Zanzibar in Tanzania. He travelled by train, he travelled by boat and every time he came back, he would say that the Rwandans think that they are intelligent, they think, they think that they know how things work, but that they know absolutely nothing. He looked at the Rwandans with disdain because he thought that they were self-absorbed and haven’t travelled at all. He would say, “I’ve travelled, I’ve seen many places, many, I’ve seen many countries.” He really had an open mind. So I think I got that from him. The curiosity, the travels, and also, the propensity for spending [smiles]. He’s someone who can’t save. When he had a little bit of money, he would leave, he would travel. So when I was accepted to high school, my father wasn’t there, he was away on his trips again and my mother asked her cousins for help. She came from a bourgeois family. Her cousins ​​were middle class, merchants. Her older brothers had large properties. It’s a really prosperous family. I remember, at my grandmother's when I was young, there were so many cows that there were cows in the back yard, mu gikari, and mu rugo, in the front yard. And I remember when we were milking the cows, we filled jugs and jugs of milk and poor people often came by the house to ask for milk. It was the distribution of milk. We gave a portion of the land to people who were poor and hungry so they could have sweet potatoes, cassava. So a middle class family like that. My mother had grown up in this milieu, which was bourgeois and authoritarian as well, because I would say that she was quite authoritarian herself. So, I succeeded in school, and she thought, “I will ask my brothers, my cousins, they will help me so that my child can continue studying.” But they all refused because I was in the same school as their own children and I was the only one who had succeeded. So the children of her brothers and her cousins ​​who studied with me, none of them had succeeded to go to secondary school, while I, the foreign child—that’s my interpretation, which I made up later on—that I came from elsewhere. The child who came from elsewhere, had succeeded. So they thought, “Her husband is not there, they’re poor and if we don’t help them, this child won’t go to school.” So they sent my mother away empty-handed, and she only had three months—because we learned that I was going to high school maybe ... it was around July ... end of June, beginning of July, and I had to start in September—so she didn’t have much time to get the minerval together and buy me a school uniform and other things. So she said to me—well, obviously on her husband’s side, her husband’s family, there was no way, there was no one there she could ask for help. So she was all alone, with almost nothing. She didn’t expect that ... and she also didn’t know what it cost to send a child to high school. So she told me, “We're going to the market.” We went to the market every Wednesday and Saturday, the local markets, and we would sell produce: sweet potatoes, cassava, beans. One week before school started I had finally raised the minerval but it was not enough, not even to buy a suitcase. I remember I took an old suitcase that my father had brought back from Uganda, the only valuable thing [smiles] that I could use. So I took my father's suitcase and I went to school, and when I got back for the Easter holidays ... —pardon me, for Christmas—my father was home. So maybe sometime in October my mother had sent someone—because there were travellers, seasonal workers who went regularly to Uganda—and I think she had sent a message for my father through someone, saying, “If you ever find out where my husband is, tell him to come back home because I need him.” So when I came back for the Christmas break, my father had come home and my mother said that she had scolded him. She had told him, “From now on, you will stay here. We have a child who has succeeded in his studies, it is absolutely necessary that you help me work to pay for his studies.” So my father stayed, obedient [laughs], and they worked hard. When I went back for    Easter break or for the summer vacation, I always went with my parents to the markets, carrying goods on my head, to get some money to pay for my studies. I remember those years well. And I’m glad to be able to say, “Yes, I worked a little bit to pay for my studies”—because, sometimes, we had to walk for almost ten kilometers, with a basket on our heads, to get to one of the markets. It wasn’t close, it was pretty far and it was important not to spend even one franc to buy a Coca-Cola or a Fanta. All the money we made, we brought back home.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And after that, at school, I would like to know—and we will speak after about when you arrived in Belgium—I would like to know what was the relationship like between you, when you were in high school, at the Groupe Scolaire as you said, what was the relationship like between the students?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"When we ..., I started high school—my first year in high school was in 1964. That year, there were—in 1963—there was unrest in the south of the country. Tutsis were massacred, I think, in retaliation for the inyenzi attack that came, I believe, from Burundi. The inyenzi was the nickname given to the Tutsi refugees who had left the country, so inyenzi, cockroaches, and they had attacked, but it was suppressed with force. Not only were they fended off—I don’t know if it was with the help of Belgium or Congo—but there was also a retaliation against the Tutsis—their huts were burned, their cows were eaten and people were killed, massacred. So when I arrived at the Groupe Scolaire, the Brothers of Charity at that time felt great animosity towards people who came from Gikongoro—I was from Gikongoro—and there had been many massacres in Gikongoro, particularly in the Cyanika Parish, the parish I was from. So they regarded us as criminals, as murderers. So everyone ... they were saying, “Everyone from Gikongoro,” they were saying, “you, the people from Gikongoro, you are murderers, you are rapists, you are assassins.” So this situation was particularly difficult. It’s true that there were people who came from important Hutu families and who were big activists, but I remember that because of the Brothers' reaction to the massacres—especially the killing of students from the school, students who were older than me by a year or two, and who didn’t come back—and those [Hutu] students who were a bit [militant?] were pretending to be nice. Other than that, the relations between Hutu and Tutsi classmates were relatively good. As we were moving from one grade to the next, the number of people from the two ethnicities was balancing itself out. At the beginning, there were a lot more Hutu students, but in fact many Hutus had obtained a place in the school even though they weren’t very bright, they weren’t very smart, and little by little they dropped out, while the Tutsis were often much brighter students. So, as we were going forward in the upper years of high school, there was a balance in the numbers of Hutus and Tutsis.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"From what I understand, you had a good relationship with your classmates, there were no problems. But it also seems to me that there was something a little ...—I don’t know if I would say strange—but the Brothers’ attitude towards the people from Gikongoro—it was a bit hurtful, was it not? Treating a young boy like a criminal, that’s not a small matter.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I must say that it ... I have memories from a few years prior to that, three years prior, from 1960, when I saw the burned huts of the Tutsis, when I saw the people that were about to be thrown in the river. These memories were still vivid in my mind and so for me the Brothers’ reaction wasn’t exaggerated. I thought their reaction was perfectly legitimate because there were indeed in my school people who, in my opinion, were there not because they were smart, but simply because they were Hutu and because they were taking the place of the Tutsis who had been killed and who couldn’t come back to school. For a teacher, it must be a terrible thing to see the third, half, or three quarters of your class disappear after the school break, due to the students’ ethnic origin. So I felt it—the fear I had was, rather, that they would say, “But you too are Hutu, you are a criminal,” whereas I wasn’t a criminal, and that, obviously, would have been hurtful. But they were speaking generally, without necessarily, to my knowledge, show animosity towards particular students. They were speaking more generally, and it was like they were telling us, “You, the people from Gikongoro,” and when they would say that, we felt as though they were saying, “you, the Hutu from Gikongoro, we are watching you, be careful.”",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It was much more problematic in Belgium. When I arrived in Belgium, the situation was such that there were some Tutsi refugees and a lot of Hutus. As I mentioned, when I got the grant to go to Belgium there were many Rwandan students with grants, but they were mostly Hutu. In fact, I don’t remember a single Tutsi who had received a government grant. All the grant recipients were Hutu. There were some Tutsis there too, but I don’t know how they had managed to come. Maybe with private scholarships or through very special relationships with people working in the government, but the Tutsis were really few and far between, the majority of students were Hutu. So there was a small minority of Tutsis, especially those who had arrived earlier, so they were older than me, and I remember they were divided into Hutu and Tutsi groups [makes a gesture of separation], especially in the local bistros: the Tutsis had their bistros and the Hutus had theirs. Two years later, the coup led by Habyarimana happened and the division became even more pronounced: the Hutus from the north, who had their bistro and who now felt in power and felt much more powerful, and the Tutsis from the south who were trying to become friends with these Hutus from the north. So the ethnic tensions became even stronger at that time, in 1973–1974.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,It was as though Rwanda's problems were transferred to Belgium.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Absolutely. It's ... even now they say that things ..., it hasn’t changed. That’s how the situation was at that time and it seems that it’s still the same today.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"If I understand correctly then, as you told me in the beginning, when you left the country you were around 20 years old, you are in Belgium, you are studying, and after graduation, did you start working or did you get married? Tell us about your family.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"When I arrived in Belgium, these ethnic issues made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The people who were strongly asserting their Hutu identity were scaring me. It was mostly people from the north, or people from the south who were a bit too militant. Given what I was explaining earlier, coming from a family … where I was like an only child—actually, when I was in high school my parents had other children that I didn’t really get to know because I wasn’t there. So I grew up as an only child, and I was protecting myself, I was being careful. I was paying attention to everything that had to do with these violent games. So, for me, this activism, these demonstrations, I kept a distance from that. When I lived in Belgium, I avoided Rwandans. I didn’t have any Rwandan friends except one of my friends from high school whose family background was more or less similar to mine. So we just kept it to ourselves and avoided these [militant?] small groups that others adhered to. And very quickly, many other students went to the bistros, they were drinking, they would get drunk, they got into fights, etc. ..., or they would go dancing. I always stayed away from them. And I got married very early. I met a fellow student who was Congolese. It had been just two years since I had arrived, maybe a year and a half, and I married her. And it was, of course, a scandal among the Rwandans, to marry a Congolese, because for a Rwandan, the Rwandans are the elite, they are almost like the chosen people. At the time, Rwandans still felt contempt for people from other nations, especially our neighbours, the Burundians and the Congolese. It was as if I had betrayed my compatriots by marrying a foreigner. But curiously, for the Congolese—because my ex—because we are divorced now—she is of ruba origin and the baruba are the proudest Congolese [laughs] who consider themselves Africans above everyone else. So they too were saying, with contempt, “Their daughter is going to marry this little Rwandan.” They almost sabotaged the marriage and the situation was pretty tense. When the Rwandans learned about that they said, “The Congolese want to beat one of our own, we will fight back”—that was the situation, more or less. But after the wedding, I spent more time with the Congolese community. I’ve always liked the Congolese, I’ve always liked their spirit of openness, they don’t take life too seriously—the small groups—in any case, at the time it was like that. They are people who rose above these things. They are also great intellectuals because it was ... at the time I was spending time with people who were great intellectuals and gradually, later on, I think, when I was in Rwanda I lost contact with the Rwandans. I was more in the Congolese community.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So you got married and then you had children ... so I guess the family of your ex-wife was wondering how come she married a Rwandan and on your side the Rwandans were saying, how come he married a Congolese. So how were things for you as a couple, how was your relationship?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I was a responsible person, of course, I was a good father, I had two children, I looked after my children well and my studies were going well. Many of my fellow students from the same faculty took many years to graduate and I finished in ..., I was going from one year to the next in my program without a problem. So, as I wasn’t seeing the Rwandans much, it's as if they completely forgot about me and as for the Congolese, they ended up understanding that, yes, I was just a small Rwandan, but a small Rwandan who was respectable, who respected their daughter, who took good care of my children and who worked hard. So the Congolese accepted me and I lived in their community like one of them, really. I felt much more at ease there because there were no ethnic issues. I must say that I was more in the baruba community, which was a very big community, with very proud people. They are really very proud, great workers too who loved working, who were brilliant and who had something to be proud of because they came from a great country, that was a fact.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"While you were in Belgium, did you maintain your relationship with your parents who remained in Rwanda?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes ... of course at the time we communicated by letters, I wrote to them, and like all Rwandans who were not very well-off, I would even say poor, I regularly sent money, from my grant, I sent money to my parents. I was able to go back to Rwanda only once during the holidays to see my parents, in 1975. I went by myself and it was then that I met my young sisters who were still tiny little babies. So I saw that we finally had a family and the neighbours now knew that this child that they had never known was my father’s son. They looked down on my father, hated him, but then began to respect him because they saw that he had a child who had gone far away, abroad. So people were looking at me, I would even say with some sort of fear. It was really respect mixed with fear because they knew—all that they’ve made my parents go through, all the discrimination that my parents had to endure, the rejection, the contempt and now they saw that my parents had a child who might later have a good future. But I would say that it was too late to invest in this relationship with the neighbours. It was too late, on both my father's side and on my mother's side, because I hadn’t forgotten that my mother's family had refused to help us, and I thought, “I don’t have a relationship, I don’t have a connection with that family, I’ve got nothing to do with them.” So since I left in 1964, I didn’t set foot again in the place where I grew up, at my mother’s family, until very recently, actually, last year, after 45 years. So I cut them off—and on my father's side too—the people who had persecuted my parents so much that I never wanted to have a relationship with them. So I was like an only child with no attachment, neither on my mother’s side, nor on my father’s, which is something very rare in African cultures, and in Rwandan culture particularly, not to have attachment on either side of the family.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"No, after my studies in Belgium the circumstances were such that I went back to Rwanda. One of my cousins ​​was rector of the university. And another set of circumstances—the National University of Rwanda was, as you know, founded by Canadians, by Father George-Henri Levesque, and there were many Canadians who taught in the different faculties there at the time. But in the year when I returned, Canada had decided to gradually withdraw from the various faculties and had started by withdrawing from the faculty of economics and the social sciences. In this faculty there was a teaching position open in psychology and it was the first position that was rwandanized—this was part of the process of rwandanization of the workplace. So the Canadian psychologist who worked there had left and the position was vacant. And when I arrived my cousin, who was the rector of the university, told me, “There’s an open position for a professor of psychology and you can fill it”—because there was no other psychologist at that time. I was one of the first psychologists in the country. So, again, by a set of circumstances I became professor, I would say, without having to go through too many steps. The position was open and I was the only person who could fill it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,That's when I came to Canada.,Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,So tell us how did everything go when you arrived in Canada?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"First, maybe I can tell you how I got the grant, because it wasn’t easy. I was a professor of psychology and I was teaching courses in social psychology. Social psychology courses address many issues: crowd psychology, manipulation, how we form opinions, critical thinking and I was excessively critical and wanted my students to develop their critical thinking too. Many people thought that maybe I was going too far, because I was too critical, of course, especially when I was talking about manipulation and when I was talking about how people sometimes collaborate with a ruling regime out of fear or in order to obtain privileged positions. So many people thought that talking about all of this was a dangerous thing to do, that I was on a very slippery slope. It was a military regime, the rule of Habyarimana, but I thought to myself, “I’m a professor, my mission is to educate young people and I’m a psychologist, I would feel bad if I taught lies, if I taught things I don’t believe in,” so I just continued and hoped for the best. I knew that some of my students were secret agents, and I would address them directly. I would tell them, “There are students among us who are secret service agents.” Some of their fellow students were scared by this, because they would come and tell me that some of their classmates would scare and threaten them, and I addressed this in class with my students. I would speak directly to those students and say, “If you are a secret service agent of this country—there isn’t a country in the world that doesn’t need secret service agents. The Americans have the CIA, the Russians have the KGB, and so on. So if you do your work, if there are enemies who want to attack the country and you really are a person who has to inform the secret service, well, that’s great, you are doing a service to your country. But if ever you make a case with false information against a fellow student, know that sooner or later you will pay for that. Especially since, as you know, revolutions often take place in Africa.” At that time, in the 1970s, there had been a military coup every year. So I would say to these young people, “Look, the ruling powers change constantly. If you accuse someone unjustly today, tomorrow the regime might change and the person could seek revenge. So be conscious of what you’re doing when you’re doing this.” The students were scared, they were shaking from fear. Some of the students who felt close to me came to see me and said, “There are many unhappy students and they are putting together a dossier on you.”  [Pause]",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,So you were teaching at the National University of Rwanda and you were going to tell us how you obtained the grant.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So, given my attitude—I was very critical and I didn’t want to play the same game as other professors who were really pandering to the regime. The President’s brother was teaching at the Faculty of Medicine and I still remember that many of my colleagues [indistinct] to get on his good side, and every time I saw him when we went out for a beer, I used the opportunity to criticize him and denounce his brother’s policies. I was behaving like an academic should, like what I was used to doing in Belgium and I think that in a way, I was telling him: “Listen, Séraphin … when you consider … you are an academic, when you consider everything that’s happening in this country and there are journalists and people who write about our country—you have to give good advice to your brother.” Some things are unacceptable. For example, when professors in a university like this one can go as far as be afraid even of a driver[?], be afraid of their students, it’s shameful.” And I think that because I was saying out loud what I was thinking, people were looking at me as a sort of a court jester. That guy wasn’t stupid. And I think maybe he understood that it was better to know the truth directly instead of receiving false praise. I was never scared of Séraphin. Especially since I said to myself that I have nothing to lose, after all. I didn’t have any material possessions, I didn’t have properties, I had absolutely nothing. I only had my job, which I liked, and that was all. But at the same time, I knew that I couldn’t really hope to obtain a grant. Still, in 1980, in the early 1980s, the Canadian delegation arrived to select the fellows. They were awarding grants. Most of us, professors, we had master's degrees, but not doctorates, and after teaching for two-three years, we could get a grant to come to Canada. I wasn’t eligible because I was in the social sciences. Those who were eligible for a doctorate were in science, agricultural science, in the faculty of biology, but I was in the social sciences. It was no longer a priority for Canada and that's why my position was the first one to be rwandanized. But I had a very good relationship with my Canadian colleagues with whom I spent more of my free time than with my Rwandan colleagues. At Hotel Ibis or Hotel Faucon, where people usually went for drinks, I was there more often with my Canadian friends, my Canadian colleagues than with other Rwandans, because Rwandans always talked about politics and I couldn’t control what I was saying, because I was too critical of the regime. So I was thinking that it’s better to avoid socializing with Rwandans. I was much more at ease expressing my views in the company of Canadians. So the Canadian delegation was there to select fellows and then the dean of my faculty, who was a good friend of mine, asked the members of the delegation  if he could still put my name on the list of people to consider. They said, “Look, he's not in science—we'll place him on the list, but his application is not a priority.” So it was like telling me not to get my hopes up, I won’t get the grant. So it was around the time of the holidays, in 1980, and we were supposed to have left, the fellows were supposed to have left in September to come to Canada. When the holidays came, I said to my wife and children, “We are going to Kinshasa. We’ll go on vacation to visit the grandparents because if I ever have a chance to go to Canada, we won’t be able to come back because it’s too far. I wouldn’t have enough money to pay for the plane ticket for [inaudible, scrambled recording] ..., little children.” All the other fellows, grant candidates, said to me: “Are you mad? If ever you have a slight chance to get the grant you have to stay here so that they can process your application. You have to go to the ministry, you have to go to your administrative district, you have to be there to move your file forward.” But I was thinking that the best way to take care of my file is actually to stay away, so that they don’t think of me, that they don’t know that my name is on the list. So I did it on purpose. I thought that if I had a slight chance to go to Canada, the intelligence service agents shouldn’t be aware that my name was on the list. So I left for Kinshasa with my wife and children [inaudible, scrambled recording] and by mid-August, I went to the Canadian embassy in Kinshasa to pay a courtesy call to the ambassador. One of my former colleagues was already working there, and when the ambassador learned that a professor from the NUR [the National University of Rwanda] was there, he asked me to go into his office and said: “Listen, [inaudible, scrambled recording] ... and it's too late to send via diplomatic bag. Could you bring on my behalf to the minister of education the envelope that I'm going to give you?” I said: “Yes, no problem.” So that's how I ended up carrying the diplomatic bag [laughs]. I don’t think these kinds of things would be done now, but in the 1980s a lot of things were done this way. I asked the ambassador: “Can you tell me the names of the grant recipients?” Yes, he read the list of people and all my colleagues’ names were on it and by chance my name was also on the list. So I was really happy, I brought the envelope, I asked for a meeting with the minister of education [inaudible, scrambled recording] ..., “I bring diplomatic mail for the minister and the ambassador asked me to hand it to him in person, not to his secretary, not to anyone else, but to the minister himself. If he's not there, I'll come back.” So finally they said I could see the minister, he was there [inaudible, scrambled recording] and I said, “Mr. Minister I was just in Kinshasa, I have the list of fellows going to Canada and the ambassador showed me that my name is also on the list. So to avoid too many complicated steps, I normally have to come here and ask your permission [inaudible, scrambled recording].” He couldn’t refuse. He gave me the papers and right away I went to the administrative district, they immediately filled out the papers for me, then I went to immigration and handed them the documents. Of course, the people who worked there were my former students, [inaudible, scrambled recording]. I said, “I know you.” He said, “Yes, I was your student.” “Oh, you work here now?” “Yes, you failed me.” [laughs]. So I thought, “Forget it, I have no chance.” Finally, two weeks later I had the passport, I never understood [laughs] what happened. I jumped on the plane and I came here.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It was a very difficult time, but at the same time I’ve always been very lucky in my life. Maybe I was born under a lucky star. One of my old friends, a colleague from the National University of Rwanda, we came to Canada at the same time, and he was program director at the Université de Montréal. We had taught together in Rwanda, and at one point he was recruiting lecturers, he knew the courses I had taught and that I had the skills for that, so he hired me as a lecturer at the Université de Montréal barely three months after my arrival. So I started teaching as a lecturer at the Université de Montréal. Also, I was invited to CIDA’s pre-departure sessions in Ottawa. When Canadian aid workers were about to leave for Africa, they received training in preparation for their travel, to get to know the country, to get to know the customs, etc. So CIDA would call in resource persons [to brief the aid workers]. There weren’t too many of us at the time, resource people from Africa, and in those years there were still a lot of aid workers going to Rwanda. So they phoned the university and learned that there was a Rwandan working there. They were looking for a resource person for the aid workers going to Rwanda and I got a small contract to go and talk to people. There was no special preparation. I was to talk to them about the political system, the social, religious, educational systems, and so on. But the person who ran the program at CIDA at that time saw that I had good knowledge, that I had a lot of experience and he offered me to be not the resource person briefing the aid workers, but to give pre-departure training workshops. There already was a small team of resource persons who were giving workshops for people going abroad. So because of my background in psychology and in anthropology, I was hired as a resource person at that time at CIDA. So I started working at CIDA. I had at least one contract a month because there were regular pre-departure sessions for aid workers who were leaving; so once a month I had at least one pre-departure session, and it was very well paid. Later, when my grant got cut for political reasons, the one day that I was working at CIDA was enough to pay for my rent and food—modestly, but I never had the slightest problem paying my rent or buying food. Because of a single day of work—I did my job well, I was well-respected, I had very good evaluations, so I kept this job for years.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Because I was very critical, at one point I think it got to be a little too much. One day, the embassy summoned us to Ottawa because they intended to form units. A unit ... like the units in Rwanda, political units, here in Canada as well. So we were called to Ottawa, all the students—an important meeting to which all the students were obliged to go because if you didn’t go—and since it’s basically the Rwandan government that pays your grant—actually, it’s not the Rwandan government that pays your grant, but that negotiated your grant—it was very frowned upon. So I went. I didn’t really know what it was going to be and the ambassador told us that we were going to form units, political units here, a unit of the [inaudible, scrambled recording] and that’s why they had summoned us, so [inaudible, scrambled recording], and so on. And I said, “No, it’s out of the question. It’s an aberration.” And I firmly opposed that during the meeting. I gave my reasons, I said, “Look, we already have too many problems, there already is too much tension between us Rwandans. We don’t talk about it here[?]. But at the same time, we are lucky to be abroad and for once to be able to say what we want. And some of us are in political science, others are in psychology, sociology, in disciplines where we are being asked to speak up our mind, to say what we think and now you’re making up these units that will [inaudible, scrambled recording].” In any case, I said, “I personally am completely against this and I think it's stupefying, I think that it shouldn’t be imposed on students studying abroad. Those who want to, when they go back to Rwanda, are free to join the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (NRMDD), to wear the movement’s uniforms and so on, to wear the little medals that they were already distributing, but here I think it’s not doing any service to the students.” And what happened then was people were afraid to approach me during the dinner we were later served—I don’t remember in which hotel—nobody dared come close to me. People avoided me. It was as though they were saying, “That guy is dangerous, he's crazy. If they see us next to him, they’ll think we share the same views and the same ideas as him.” As it happens, when the minister of education visited six months later, I learned that my grant had been cut. Why? The ambassador explained that it was because of my pride. When you say … when you say of a Rwandan that he is proud, it really means that he is insolent, ungrateful, someone who is contemptuous—that sort of thing. So the minister told me that there were bad reports against me, that I was someone who had an evil spirit, that I was a bad citizen, that I was ungrateful to the country that had given me the chance to come here and that, as a consequence, they were ending my grant. And I said to the minister: ""Look, yes, you awarded me the grant, I'm the one who goes to the library, I work, I study and what I said at the embassy, ​​I was expressing my thoughts.” The minister—whom I knew well because he was a former friend from my university years in Belgium, we knew each other there too—I said, “Look,”—his name was Charles—I said, “Charles, I'm sorry, but do your homework and I’ll do mine. You can end my grant”—it didn’t matter much to me. In fact, it suited me that they would cut the grant. Why did it suit me? Because at that point, I was divorced and my wife had already been granted refugee status here with the children. She had obtained this status while I was in Rwanda doing fieldwork. So when I came back to Canada, I learned that I was separated, that my children already had a special status, and as a former CIDA fellow, I had to go back home after graduation. But as my scholarship had been cut, I considered that I no longer had ties to Rwanda. The country had reneged on me, I had been blacklisted and therefore I had nothing to do with the country anymore. So I stayed here, almost in a limbo. Luckily, I was teaching at the Université de Montréal and afterwards at UQAM because I was a good teacher and I had mastered the subject and I had good evaluations from CIDA. So CIDA ends my grant, but at the same time I get hired at another department at CIDA [laughs]. Luckily, these departments do not communicate well with each other. So finally I was able to continue working like this until I submitted my thesis, and I got a job almost immediately after I submitted it.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So, several things happened almost at the same time: the separation, the end of the grant, and I guess it was then that you decided: “I'm staying here, I'm going to make a living here in Canada”?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, I didn’t have a choice because the situation—as it often happens when people divorce—the relationship with my ex was very tense, the communication was really bad. She obtained a refugee status at the time when I was outside of the country and, in fact, I don’t know what she had said about me at the immigration office. When I left for Rwanda my file at the immigration office was small like this [shows “small” with his hands] and when I came back my file was like this [shows “big”]. Every time I went to the immigration office and they saw my name, they would send me back. They were waiting for me to submit my thesis so that they could kick me out of Canada. When I understood that, I said, “Well, I won’t submit the thesis.” So I dragged it on. The problem was that ... to renew my student status it was necessary to prove every year that I had enough money to live for a year, to be able to extend the contract. And because of this little job I had with CIDA, I had managed to save money, to put a certain amount of money in my account, and regularly made deposits at the bank, and I showed to immigration the photocopy proving that I have money in the bank. So they had no choice but to renew my visa. So I started the immigration process. At the time we had to—and I think that even now it's still the same—you had to apply for an immigrant status from outside of Canada. So I went to New York. The file was not moving forward. Every time I inquired, I was told there was some kind of a problem in Montreal. And when I came back to Montreal, nobody at the immigration office wanted to look at me. I was really discouraged and I felt really depressed. I didn’t understand what was happening. Then, by chance, one of my former Canadian colleagues from the National University of Rwanda, to whom I told my troubles, told me that one of his friends worked in the immigration office. He gave me a little note and I went to see this person at the Quebec immigration office. The person received me well and gave me a little note and said: “Go to the Quebec consulate in New York, to the Quebec delegation in New York, you will see the person in charge with this note, we will try to unblock your file.” I went there, and then everything got resolved just like that, in less than a year I finally got the famous documents [smiles] of a landed immigrant. And when I got them—I remember, it was December 17th when I went to get the papers in New York—I got the status. When I arrived there I wrote the conclusion of my thesis and I submitted it. At last I was safe.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, at that time they wanted to hire me at CIDA since I had a long ... a lot of experience, so they actually wanted to hire me [inaudible, scrambled recording], but the job ... even though I loved the work, but I could just see myself becoming a civil servant and doing things that didn’t correspond to what I had ... I thought, “Well, I didn’t do a PhD just to become a civil servant, to manage development projects when that's not my expertise.” And I hesitated. And they insisted, they said, “You have to sign the contract so we can hire you,” and I said: “Give me three more weeks.” They did and I used that time to think. Three weeks passed: “Will you sign or not?” I said, “Give me three more weeks,” and they gave me three more weeks. So finally they understood that I wasn’t interested. Why did I do that? Because I had seen a job posting for a teaching position in my field at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. So I said, “I'll try my luck.” I was really naïve. I thought that seeing a newspaper ad for a job and applying for it, that I would ... that I would be hired. I hung on to that thought and while my application was reviewed in Trois-Rivières, the people at CIDA were becoming impatient and didn’t want to wait any longer. They said, “Look, it’s clear that you don’t want this position so we’ll give it to someone else.” I said, “Okay, give it to someone else.” So I clung to that slight chance that maybe I will get the job in Trois-Rivières. So finally, I was called for an interview in Trois-Rivières. In the 1980s, the universities were not hiring. They weren’t recruiting much and I learned that 15 candidates had applied for that position. What happened was that I got the job [surprised look]. The salary was half of what I would have received at CIDA. I knew that because I had seen the work contract for the position. But I was so happy to finally be able to say that I’m working in my field and also because earning a lot of money as a civil servant, but doing a job I didn’t like—no, I wouldn’t have been happy with that at all. I knew a lot of government workers, many friends at CIDA with whom I went for a beer and with whom we chatted, and many of them had a very complicated personal life. They had serious personal problems and I didn’t want that to happen to me too. I really wanted to have a career that I like. I’ve always liked teaching and research, so I was very happy.

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Talk about ... I don’t want to say the setbacks, but the whole process you've gone through to get that famous landed immigrant status. I guess that here in Montreal or in Quebec many people often find themselves in this situation and you, as a psychologist, I imagine that you’ve met a few people—I don’t know if that’s the case—but I assume that you are the right ..., you are in a position to help people who are in a similar situation?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I am available to help, that’s for sure. In fact, on many occasions, when people were going through a tough time, I was available to help, to encourage them to get through those difficult times, help them get through this process and, especially, to tell them, “Don’t be discouraged.” One thing I always tell immigrants is: “We decide to immigrate for a reason. We leave behind much more difficult conditions of living and when we arrive here, it’s not always easy either. But even if it’s difficult, I always say, think about your children. Think about the next generation.” The first generation is the one that has to make sacrifices in the name of the generations to come. All the better if in some cases, as in my case, exceptionally, you can be lucky and get a job in your field of work, but I tell people, “Don’t expect that you will necessarily work in your field. That can be difficult. And even if it doesn’t happen, if you don’t get a job in your field of work, don’t despair, think about your children, because if you help them, if you are strong, if you don’t get discouraged, your children will have a much better chance to find what is good for them.” That’s really my message. I know, there are people who are doctors, engineers and here they have to work in a convenience store or as taxi drivers, but the important thing is to say to yourself, “I’m doing this for my children. At least I live in a free country”—because you can live in your country and … A lot of research was done in the early 1990s with teenagers from different countries, and I remember one of the interviews we did was with a gentleman who was … who used to be university president. At an university in the Middle East. He was university president and what was his job here? He worked in a convenience store. But he had remained the same gentleman, the same individual. The fact that he was working in a convenience store wasn’t the problem. He said, “I live in a free world and I work for my children. I earn my living honorably.” He recounted the life he’d had in his country, as university president—it was horrible, to always have to bow down to the police, to the secret service and to know that at any moment all kinds of problems can befall you. And now he was living in a free world and I think it's the same thing ... My hope, of course, is that the host society will make an effort to really integrate immigrants because, on the one hand, many immigrants are accepted here, thousands every year, but on the other hand, we don’t really make a big effort to integrate them, whereas immigrants are among the most educated people in Quebec. That's a shame, I think, it truly is unfortunate, because many resources are left unused in this way.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"And ever since you came to Quebec—it’s been a long time since you left your country even if you went back to visit last year. Since you left, many things have happened in Rwanda, your country of origin—there was a war and then a genocide, and then [inaudible]. I would think that even from a distance, you couldn’t have remained unmoved by these events. I don’t know if you wish to share what you felt at that time.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, it’s … certainly the tragedy and the drama of the genocide that our country experienced has shaken not only all Rwandans, any good Rwandan citizen, but also all citizens of the world, because, as they say, a genocide is a crime against humanity, it strikes at the very psychological integrity of every individual because it’s an utterly barbaric act. In fact, I can look back and say that what happened …, the genocide in particular—because you mentioned the war—yes, the war of 1990. When the war broke out in 1990, my father had passed away three weeks earlier. My father died in the beginning of September and when I learned about his death, the semester was just starting. I said, “I’ll go visit my mother in December, because, in any case, by the time it takes me to leave, he will already be buried. And the semester is starting, it’s of no use, I’ll go in December.” But I couldn’t go in December because the war started in October.   There was an attack by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and I couldn’t go to Rwanda then. And the war went on and at one point I felt scared. My young children who hadn’t seen their grand-parents, were growing up and I thought, “What would happen if the war persists?” That’s when I thought, “I’ll bring over my mother so she can see her grand-children, since you never know what might happen.” In fact, I already had that idea, to bring both my parents to Canada, when I got the position in Trois-Rivières. Both of them—thinking that it would be a nice gift I can give them for having paid for my studies. I will show them Canada. And since I also have a training as an anthropologist, I wanted at the same time to do a little research. I wanted to see what impressions they would have of this country. I wanted to see them walking around, travelling, visiting cities and so on and just listening to them comment on what they were seeing, observing two people who had left their native village, who have never lived in a city and who are propelled in a city like Montreal. That was the project I had in mind. It didn’t become a reality, because my father passed away. But my mother came right away because I thought, “No, it’s out of the question that she might die without having seen her grand-children and without her grand-children having seen her.” So my mother came, she saw her grand-children and I showed her around. We even went to the United States to visit a friend who lives there, in the state of New York and then my mother went back to Rwanda. Two years later, in 1992, she passed and when I phoned in Rwanda, my friends told me, “Listen, stay where you are, we don’t want to have another dead body here”—because at the time, people were being killed in a haphazard fashion. They were killing people left and right, political opponents, and my friends, who more or less knew my history with the regime—even though I never officially proclaimed myself a political opponent, but I never carried the Habyarimana banner, either—nevertheless, people were aware of my political positions. So they said, “Listen, stay there, we will do the funeral rituals for your mother, and you’ll come see your younger sisters after the war—if the war ever ends.” And after that, unfortunately, what happened, happened: the tragedy that struck our country. And the fact that I couldn’t go back to see my mother, to me that was… she had just died … her child … my mother loved me very much, she spoiled me. I didn’t go back to pay my last respects to my father. And I thought to myself, “My parents passed, I live abroad, it’s strange.” I found this situation really unfair. At the same time, of course, I was aware of the risk of visiting Rwanda at that time. I thought, “It will be too dangerous.” It was very difficult for me. It was very difficult that after everything my parents have done for me I wasn’t there to do the proper rituals sending them off on their final journey. When the genocide happened—I can tell you, I’ve always thought that—considering Habyarimana’s regime—I always thought that there would be … that there would be retaliation, a continuous and systematic killing. I wasn’t surprised. I never thought that a genocide would happen. In fact, I think, many other people didn’t either—starting with the Tutsis themselves—I don’t think anyone ever imagined such a thing, or the people would have left the country because I remember that even when the killings had started in Kigali, I phoned several friends who were in Butare and I told them, “Listen, come here, it’s time to leave the country. It’s not going well. In any case, from the news we get here, it looks like things are bad.” My friends were saying, “Oh no, it’s not that bad, here in Butare all is calm, all is under control, we have a good prefect who manages things well, don’t worry,” and so on. And we were really surprised when it happened. But at the same time, when I look back, it wasn’t all that surprising. I look back to 1960, I was 9-10 years old then. My teacher was Tutsi and when they were burning the houses on the hills in front of Bunyambiriri, I remember I ran to my teacher and said, “I’m scared. Look, everywhere they are burning the houses.” And then they started burning the houses close to the school. I said, “I’m scared, what’s going to happen to us?” And he said, “Don’t be scared, this shouldn’t concern you, nothing will happen to you, be calm.” A true umubyeyi, a good parent. He knew that his time would soon come, yet he was still kind enough to calm a frightened child. Several weeks later they came, destroyed his house, massacred many of his relatives. He narrowly escaped, but they killed his sister and they killed his little sister who was in the same class as me. The memories I have from that time … I remember it was during the rainy season. It must have been April-May. The images I remember when I was 9-10 years old … it must have been in April when many of the killings happened. I was at my grand-mother’s. There weren’t many Tutsis where I lived, in my grand-mother’s village. Only Hutus. After that, of course, I found out … well, those are things that I could only know afterwards—that there weren’t any Tutsis there, only Hutus. So there were no burning houses near where I lived, because there were only Hutus, but I saw troops in the distance, people with spears, with arrows.  And I saw fire on the surrounding hills. And my grandmother told me, “Don’t move, stay here, because there is a war going on.” But a 10-year old child—try holding back a 10-year old who is also curious. And I was a very curious child. I was scared, but at the same time I was curious. And I think, at one point, she asked me to get some wood or go buy some salt, I don’t remember, but I went running to the small trading centre, which was maybe a 10-minute walk away from my house, up the hill, and that’s when I saw the troops and lines and lines of Tutsis who were going to be thrown in the Rukarara river. I hid behind a house, behind a shop and I have this image of one of my aunts coming out of her house and running towards a woman who was holding a little girl by the hand. It was a friend of my aunt’s, she hugged her, the two women hugged, and my aunt told her, “Murabeho rero” [“Goodbye”]. She had the courage—she was the only one who had the courage to hug a friend of hers who was facing death and she realized that. So I witnessed this moment and I saw elderly people, women, children, all very calm, who weren’t saying anything, who were walking as if in a religious procession, and the people who were going to be thrown in the river. I went back to the house and that’s one image … it was in 1960 … an image that I’ve remembered since then. All of those people perished. There were some stories of children who were able to escape—some by swimming, others simply by chance, clinging to a reed in the middle of the river—but most of those people are dead. It's a traumatizing scene for a 10 year-old child to see. In any case, for me it was a very traumatizing scene. I don’t remember when exactly, but I think it was after the holidays, sometime after the Christmas holidays in 1961—other massacres happened in 1961 and some of my classmates had to flee, as well as one of my teachers. They fled to the Cyanika Parish. That’s where they took refuge. They stayed at the church for weeks. They were even going to the toilet inside, because they would have been massacred if they went outside. These people were under the protection of a white missionary priest called Father De Jamblinne who saved many people in Cyanika in 1960. I remember one of my classmates—we must have been in 5th grade—I remember, after three weeks, I think, or a month, he came out of that church and came back to our class, and I felt ashamed. To see my Tutsi classmates, who for three weeks, a month or more [?], I don’t remember exactly … in that church … I didn’t know what to say. We said absolutely nothing to each other. We continued to study in the same class, later we went to the Groupe Scolaire high school, and it was the same thing there. We would learn that the family of such and such young person had been killed. He had escaped, maybe he had a brother or a sister, but we weren’t told absolutely anything. In high school, we never—not the Brothers, at the time, nor any of the teachers—it was like a taboo, we didn’t talk about what had happened in the country. It is completely strange.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,And there was a lot to talk about!,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"There was. But the subject was taboo. My classmates and I were playing, we were playing together, and one of my classmates had a big scar on his arm and I learned that he had been thrown into a fire. His arm was completely burned. I was never able to ask the question. None of my Hutu classmates asked him the question. If he had told the story it must have been to some of his fellow Tutsis. So we were studying together in the same classroom, maybe half Hutu, half Tutsi, but it was a taboo topic. We never talked about what happened in 1960, or in 1961, or in 1963. It was a taboo topic at school. I had many friends at school. I found out later that they were Tutsi because they were killed in 1994. I could guess that some of them were Tutsi, but we were friends, their ethnicity wasn’t of concern to me, all the more because I didn’t come from one of those big and powerful Hutu families. I came from a very low-key, very poor Hutu family, nta maboko, really powerless. So, I’d say that I was much more likely to relate to those who were as powerless as I was, rather than to the powerful ones. Clearly, I was more drawn to—I felt I had more in common with several of my Tutsi classmates, rather than the Hutus. In any case, the Hutus who were quite militant and who were proclaiming their ethnicity were scaring me because I could see that they were people one should really be wary of. So for me 1960 is … when the genocide happened in 1994, I thought about those years, actually. I never forgot those years of my youth. They’re imprinted on my mind. And in 1994 when, like many Rwandans, I was watching the events unfold on TV and reading about it in the newspapers—my wife was seven months pregnant in April 1994. I could see her belly, big like that, and I was reading the horror stories happening in Rwanda—pregnant women being disemboweled—and I would look at my wife, I was reading these stories and I was thinking, “It’s not possible.” I’ve always believed in God, but now my faith had abandoned me. I was thinking, “How can God allow such things to happen?” At the time of the genocide, I challenged many religious people. I say “challenged” because I would ask them, “How can you explain the presence of God if things like this are happening? How can God sacrifice people in this way?” And after the genocide, I was even asking those survivors who were believers, who went to church, who prayed. I often asked them this question; I said, “What is the source of your faith? Do you sometimes feel abandoned by your faith? I’m asking you why does God allow things like this to happen? Whole families have been destroyed, separated. What happened?” These are just questions … without answers. I think that faith … God truly is a  mystery but these are questions that haunt me, still to this day. My son’s birth was approaching, and following the Rwandan tradition, I thought, “What name should I give to this child?” I found him a name, I called him Uzaribara: he will be the one to tell the story. His mother is Québécoise, but he has a double Rwandan-Québécois identity. Now he’s 17 years old, as are all children born during the genocide, and he is proud of his name. Last year, we went to Rwanda together. People would ask what his name is and … Habimana, and he would add Uzaribara. People were saying, “What does Uzaribara mean?” He will be the one to tell the story. Of course, the genocide, he didn’t really … on the one hand, he didn’t experience it because he was in his mother’s belly. But on the other, the genocide … he knows about it because he hears his father talk about it almost every day. He even said to me, “You live in the genocide.” Because when I talk about my research, when I talk about my publications, when I talk about … since 1994, I’ve only done research on the genocide. I abandoned the other lines of research that I was interested in and dedicated my work to studying the genocide.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Emmanuel, by revisiting the history of your country from 1960, 1994 and now, what are the emotions that stir within you?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"The emotions that stir within ... it's not sadness. It's stronger than sadness. I’ve gone through many emotions. Of course, there is the feeling of discouragement with the human race, there is the feeling of abandonment, and there are also all these baffling questions. For many years I felt a heavy burden. A feeling of shame. Shame to be a Hutu. I have to say, in the beginning, when I first arrived here in 1980, people were asking me, “Where are you from?” And I would say, “I come from Rwanda,” and people often said: “Rwanda?” [expression of ignorance] They were thinking of Angola. Rwanda was an unknown country. Nobody spoke of Rwanda. So it was often necessary to explain: “Well, it's a small country, it's in Central Africa” and people would say, “Oh, Rwanda, Burundi. That’s where the Hutus and the Tutsis are. Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?” That’s the question that people asked me often. Obviously, for me, back then, that was hogwash [makes a gesture showing that he ignored the question]. It's a lot more complex than that. I never answered this question, if I'm Hutu or Tutsi, because I never felt Hutu. I never identified as Hutu and the fact that when I lived abroad, in Belgium, I was more a part of the Congolese community, I socialized with the Congolese, married a Congolese, had Congolese friends, I identified more as an African. I was close with intellectuals who were activists, with whom I discussed issues of postcolonialism, issues of decolonization—that was my identity. The identity of being black, of living in Belgium where black people were discriminated against and feeling that black people … whether you come from Angola, from Senegal, from wherever, you are first and foremost black. But when the genocide happened and people would ask me “are you Hutu or are you Tutsi,” I couldn’t hide anymore. I would say that I'm Hutu and that's when I started to take on this identity. Yes, I saw myself as Hutu. To be Hutu after the genocide is to be seen as the villain, to be seen as the murderer. I have accepted this identity and it’s very difficult to live with this identity, especially when you are a professor and every year you meet 150, 200, 300 students and at the beginning of each year I ask students to introduce themselves and when it's my turn to introduce myself the students always ask me, “Where are you from? What is your accent? What is your country?” I can’t simply say I'm Rwandan and this Hutu-Tutsi identity business is hogwash. I tell them I'm Rwandan and I'm Hutu. And every time when people ask me that question and when I say that I'm Hutu, some feel a little uncomfortable because in their minds a Hutu is a murderer. He’s a villain, while they see an intellectual standing in front of them. Someone who doesn’t seem to be mean, who doesn’t look like a bad guy. And they say, “It’s strange, we thought that the Hutus were the bad guys.” And then I take the time to explain, “Not all Hutus are, the story is much more complex. In fact, there are those we call moderate Hutus who also died during the genocide.” And I take the time to explain what really happened during the conflict. But to go back to your question—a feeling of sadness, a feeling of desolation and also a feeling of shame. Shame when facing my Tutsi compatriots. I live in Trois-Rivières. To this day, I’m the only Rwandan there—I think there may be one or two others that I don’t know, that I haven’t seen, but it seems that there are a few, but I live alone there. But when I come here in Montreal, obviously there is a large Rwandan community here and I have friends, I know people who are Tutsi and I felt bad meeting the Tutsis when I came here in Montreal. What would I say to them? I thought, if I tell them “I sympathize with your tragedy, with your suffering,” will they believe me? Because we are Rwandans, and we know that Rwandans can say nice things, but things they might not believe in. And I thought to myself, “I can’t express my feelings of sympathy to someone who is suffering because he will think that I’m a hypocrite.” I felt this unease, but at the same time, I thought, “This feeling of uneasiness is nothing compared to the tragedy this person has been through.” I felt really torn from the inside and even more so when I met Hutus and the Hutus thought that since I'm Hutu, they can criticize the current Tutsi regime in front of me. That really makes me mad. I’ve experienced all these mixed emotions of sadness, anger, shame for almost 10 years now.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"You’ve felt different emotions because of the events in Rwanda, but are there things that have stayed with you even to this day?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes. The images we saw on TV of bodies being thrown in the river, or of decomposing bodies, or people being cut by machetes. These are things that I’ve seen and that have devastated me. I couldn’t understand how one can commit acts like these, how one can hate and carry out such atrocities against another human being. Even animals are killed with certain dignity to avoid their suffering. It’s unspeakable. I cannot describe the feelings I’ve had since the genocide happened. I’ve lived for a long time with these wrenching emotions: a kind of shame, a kind of guilt. Why guilt? It even happens that I would remember a Tutsi friend or a classmate whom I’ve criticized, with whom I’ve had a fight, with whom I’ve argued, and I would feel guilty. I thought, “Oh, if he’s alive now, he might recall that I am Hutu and he would see me as a potential genocide perpetrator.” I would go so far as to imagine stuff like that, while in life, of course, we argue, we have conflicts, disputes with all kinds of people. Whenever a commemoration of the genocide was organized here in Montreal, I would watch the news, read the newspapers, watch the procession of Tutsis going to the river to throw flowers, and I wanted to come. But I thought, “I can’t show up among the Tutsis. I’m Hutu—what are they going to say?” They will say “naje kubashinyagurira,” they will say “naje kubabyina ku mubyimba.” These are Rwandan expressions that are very difficult to translate. It’s as though I was ... “kubyina ku mubyimba” is dancing over the pain of a neighbour: he has just lost a family member and while the others are mourning the deceased, you come and dance around the body. You are so happy, you drink, you beam with pleasure. That's what kubyina ku mubyimba means. And I thought, “If I join my Tutsi compatriots who are commemorating the death of loved ones, I'm Hutu and they’d think I had came to dance around the corpse, kubyina ku mubyimba, they’d think that naje kubashinyagurira, and I thought, “I can’t do this to them. Out of respect I will live through my suffering and distress on my own, watching the commemorations on TV, but I can’t do this.” But, at the same time, year after year, I was thinking, “But I meet these people occasionally anyways because I know some of them and I ask them for news, if there are any survivors … they’d say I’m a hypocrite: ‘He doesn’t even come to help us, he doesn’t even come to our aid, not even to the commemorations’.” I was torn between these emotions. And for the 10th anniversary commemoration, I talked to a friend of mine about it, he’s one of the organizers. One of my friends, Callixte Kabayiza, I told him that I wanted to come to the commemoration. But I told him that I absolutely didn’t want to make people feel derided in their suffering by a Hutu in their midst. I said, “I really don’t want people to think that. I would like to come and commemorate with you because I also lost Tutsi friends in the genocide and I lost Hutu friends in the genocide, but that’s not my main motivation. It's because this has shaken me to my core. It’s a crime against humanity. One doesn’t need to be Rwandan to feel heartbroken by what happened. I would like to be there with you in solidarity.” Callixte told me: “If you only knew that, on the contrary, we would be glad if Hutus come as well, if someone like you could come to the commemoration.” And so I was there for the 10th anniversary commemoration. That year, Callixte and I also organized a conference on the topic of survivors’ mental health. There were presentations, I participated at the round table, and from then on I started coming to every commemoration, to the vigils with the Tutsi community and I also became involved in research on the genocide, and in initiatives like this interview project.",Interviewee,No Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,Did you feel welcome in the community of genocide survivors?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I was really touched, I was surprised by their welcome. I thought that people will feel insulted and that people will feel angry, but at the same time I thought to myself—once I made the decision to come, I said to myself: “Yes, there may be some Tutsis who would feel angry to see a Hutu there and this at least would allow them to express their anger towards a Hutu who’s there, to let them get those feelings out because that would make them feel good. I know that I haven’t—not only have I not committed a crime, but I didn’t support—I wasn’t an accomplice. But if my presence allows someone to let go of their anger and that I am, at least, a scapegoat, that would be a good thing. Even if they insult me, even if they pour beer on me, even if they point a finger at me as a genocide perpetrator, what is my suffering, my humiliation compared to what they have gone through? That's what I always think. I always think, “Wherever I am, if a Tutsi begins insulting Hutus, even if at some point I feel angry, if I feel annoyed, whatever feeling I have—shame, fear, tension—it’s nothing compared to what people have experienced. It’s nothing compared to the wound that they live with. Since then, not only did I go to the commemoration, but a year later, a few Rwandans came here from Rwanda for the conference and I met them and they said: “Emmanuel, it would be good if you come to Rwanda.” Because after I left Rwanda in 1980, I only went back there to do fieldwork, because CIDA required us to go back to Rwanda and do work on the ground, and I was afraid that I would be held there, that I wasn’t going to come back. And when, luckily, I came back here, I said, “That’s it. I have nothing to do with Rwanda, it’s over.” I didn’t return there during the whole time of Habyarimana’s rule. Then the genocide happened and I didn’t go back to Rwanda. So, in 1985, I returned to Rwanda for the first time after 25 years. After 23 years, let's say, because the last time I was there was in 1983–1984, so for 22–23 years I had not set foot in Rwanda.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,You told me that you went back again last year.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"The first time I went back to Rwanda was in 1985. I attended a conference there. I didn’t go to the country’s interior. But I did go to Butare, where I grew up and where I taught. Of course, I visited the Kigali Memorial. I think when we go back to Rwanda, when we visit this memorial, it's a truly moving place. Especially when you go to the section dedicated to children. I had shivers when I was there, I flinched, I cried, I became almost inconsolable. Once again I was thinking, “It’s not possible.” No one can understand how things like that can happen—neighbours who kill their neighbours, things like that. Remembering the images from Gikongoro when I was young in 1960—so from the village where I grew up at my grandmother's—I wanted to go back to Gikongoro, especially when I learned that the biggest memorial, the most harrowing in Rwanda is in Gikongoro, in Murambi. So in my imagination, in my memories, I thought that there certainly are people in this Murambi memorial that I knew and they were killed by people I also knew, people from Gikongoro. And not only people I knew, but maybe even members of my family, particularly on my mother's side. So to go back to Gikongoro, where I went to elementary school, I didn’t want to set foot there. I really didn’t want to go back to that place. Last year, I went to Rwanda for my sabbatical year and my friend Callixte was there too and I accompanied him to his home in Kibeho. Then ... he was going to show me his home for the first time and I remember asking him ...: “Callixte where was your house? Where was your parents' house?” He said, “I think it was here” ... because he had [shows “a house” with his hands], the sorghum has grown, it was all fields now. And then at one point he said: “Oh no, it wasn’t here. No, actually, it's there [points to a place]. It’s over there.” And I said, “Callixte, how do you feel coming here, to the place where your parents were killed?”—because we went to the Kibeho memorial where his parents had been killed. And I said, “Where do you get the courage to come here?” He said, “It’s important to come, because I grew up here and the people who killed us, who killed our people must see that we are survivors and that we are still alive. That’s why I’m back here.” Actually, when we were leaving his house, we met a man who was suspected of having killed many people on his hill. That's when I told Callixte that I don’t have the courage to go back to the place where I grew up, and which I left in 1964, because of my memories as a little boy, in 1964, when I saw the people who were going to be thrown in the Rukarara River, and the memory of that aunt who was hugging her friend—the image had stayed in my mind like a photograph. And Callixte said to me, “Maybe you should go back there. You should go back because you grew up there.” [sighs] I summoned up my courage and I went there with my daughter. My daughter was born in Belgium and this was her first visit to Rwanda after 30 years. And so she saw the neighbourhood where we lived in Butare and she had never been there before, to this place where I grew up. She had visited my parents' house, where my parents lived, but not this place where I went to primary school. So I went there with my family. It was like a pilgrimage. I thought to myself, “Who am I going to meet in this place and, especially, what have they done?” Because my fear was: I will meet people who may have killed others and they will hug me. I will shake hands with people who have also held machetes, who have severed the head of a child or the head of a woman, and I will hug those people. To me, going to this place ... I forbade myself to go there, I said “I can’t go.” So, I summoned up my courage and I arrived on this hill and I saw an old man working in his field. I recognized him: one of my cousins. I greeted him. Of course, I didn’t say who I was, no one could know who I was—it had been 45 years since the last time I had set foot there. But he had heard that I had come, and he guessed it: “Is that you, Emmanuel?” I said, “Yes, it’s Emmanuel.” His name is Antoine. I said, “Yes, Antoine, it’s me, Emmanuel.” He came closer, we hugged, we greeted each other, I introduced him to my daughter. So I saw the place where I had grown up, and, of course, I was curious to know what he had done during the genocide. How he had behaved. This was for sure the burning question on my mind. I absolutely had to ask him. So I asked him the question. I said, “Can you tell me what happened during the genocide?” He is now 80 years old. He said, “Listen, me ... one of my children was sick, the people ran away, the neighbours left but I stayed here, quietly. My child was sick, I am a widower, my wife had died, and I didn’t want to go abroad. I didn’t kill anyone, I didn’t steal anybody’s cows. I am comfortable in my property here, that you see, I had nothing to fear—why go abroad? Why run away when I wasn’t guilty? I stayed here.” It was really like a weight lifted off my shoulders to see that [wipes tears from his eyes] ... I get emotional when I speak about this man who for me truly is a righteous man. I was deeply moved seeing him and it was like a confirmation that there are still righteous people in this world. He’s a righteous man; there are also survivors among the righteous. Those were the thoughts that were going through my mind. I was so happy to hear that, to see that this man, who is 80 years old, he stayed there, he didn’t move, he didn’t kill, he protected his family. So he told me that the RPF soldiers came, at some point everyone had fled but him. So they wanted to know why he hadn’t run away. He told them, “I didn’t run because I haven’t killed anyone.” “Do you have money?” He said, “Yes, I have money.” He had a lot of money. He said, “I have cows, I have a property, I sell things at the market.” Finally, they let him go, they left. And I was happy to see this righteous man there.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It was a pilgrimage, as you said.",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, and then I went to my elementary school and ran into one of my old classmates who now teaches there. With his class of children and with my daughter—we took a lot of pictures of the children. I couldn’t talk to him, though. Of course, I didn’t want to come off as an investigator, asking people what such and such person had done, and so on. I was happy to see the little children who were there. The future, the young children, innocent smiles. And my daughter was so happy to see where her father went to school, and we took a lot of pictures. In fact, I made them into a photo album and then a calendar, which I sent to my friend the teacher so he could put it up in the classroom. A calendar with the pictures of his class of children, thinking that it is good for the kids to see that someone who has studied well, who has sat on the same school benches as them, someone from this little village, has been able to go far in his life. It could be inspiring for some to see that I had come back with my daughter. I’m sure that this will inspire one or two of them to dream that one day they can go even farther, they can accomplish things, leave that place or stay there and help develop the country further, saying, “There is one man who is from here and he went far in his life, and he didn’t forget about us, and he came back to see us.” I was really happy to be there. Another person who made my return a happy one was a cousin of mine. We grew up together as little children and she was very protective of me. She is an extremely kind woman and I remember, in 1960 precisely, when the killings were happening, when they were killing the Tutsis’ cows and eating the Tutsis’ cows, she told me: “If anyone offers you meat, don’t take it. It’s devil’s meat. These people are criminals. You have to pray and guard your spirit against corruption.” This woman overprotected me. She was extraordinarily kind. So, she told me that during the genocide, she had hidden a little child whose parents had just been killed. The child was playing with my cousin’s children and at night they went to pick up the child and they hid the child in her home. Then at some point ... because the neighbours were sending other children to investigate if there weren’t any more children hidden there—you’ve got to be pretty depraved to send a child, because you know that an adult will hide the truth—so the neighbours were sending young children saying, “The kids like to play 02: 22: 15 together. Go check if there’re any children hidden there.” But my cousin is smart and she had told her own children: “We shouldn’t say that we are hiding a child here because they’re sending their children baje gutata”—that’s the expression she used: “they come here to spy”—“we mustn’t tell them that we’ve hidden a child here.” So they kept this child safe until the end of the genocide. My cousin remained true to herself. Her name is Marguerite. She is a truly wonderful woman.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"So, your visit to Rwanda was very beneficial for you, after all?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Yes, it was healing. For example, when I visited my cousin with my daughter, I said: “Tell me, what did you do during the genocide? Did you flee to Congo like the others?” And she said, “Why flee? We haven’t done anything. We haven’t killed anyone.” She had told my younger sisters ...—I had bought another property for my parents, I didn’t want my parents to stay in the ​​Gikongoro region, so I bought them property near Nyanza. During the genocide, my younger sisters … my mother had passed, my father had passed, they said, “We don’t know anyone here, they are killing people, we must go back to where we’re from because we know people there.” So they went back, and when they arrived, my cousin Marguerite told them: “Go home, stay in your house, you haven’t killed anyone—why flee? Why should you go to Congo?” Because people were saying, “We have to flee, the RPF is coming, they will kill everyone.” “But they won’t kill you—you haven’t killed anyone, stay quietly where you are.” So she did well to give good advice to my younger sisters who stayed in their house, the old family house, and she also stayed with her husband until the end of the genocide. I must say that my imagination had been fired up because with the stories I had in my mind from the 1960s of people who were burning houses, of people eating Tutsis’ cows, of people killing, and so on, it was like … I was getting a little paranoid. I was thinking, “I’m going to meet people who had killed others and these people will hug me, will shake my hand. And I don’t want to shake hands with someone who had held a machete, who had killed. I don’t want to hear that. I don’t want to be among people like that.” So, to see these people who had not spilled anyone’s blood, who had not committed crimes, made me feel good that I had come back.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"It is strange because I’ve visited many African countries in the last few years. I spent my sabbatical year in 2004–2005 in South Africa, I’ve been to Senegal, to Mali, to other countries, to Burkina Faso. And then I arrive in Rwanda and I see a well-organized country. I see a clean country. I see a country where people are working. I see a tidy country, I’d say. Before going there, I imagined that the country would be completely broken. I imagined roads full of holes. I imagined dilapidated houses. I imagined a country that had been destroyed like some of its neighbouring countries that I’ve visited. And when I went to Rwanda, I saw real efforts to physically rebuild the country. That’s amazing. I say “physically rebuild” because, certainly, when you start talking to people, when they ask questions, they talk about the dead. Especially in Kigali—since I taught at the university there, I couldn’t go five meters down the street without seeing someone I knew. The first year when I was in Kigali, I could walk down the street without meeting anyone I knew. When I visited Butare, where I had taught, where I had studied, and where, theoretically, I should know many people, I walked around a lot. I had taken a taxi from Kigali to Butare and when approaching Butare, in Rwabuye, so up the hill, really towards the town of Butare, I told the driver, “You go on, I’ll continue on foot from here.” I wanted to reconnect with this little town where I grew up, where I had worked and I thought to myself, “Let’s see how many people I know here.” I … from Rwabuye to the National University of Rwanda, I didn’t meet anyone I knew. I went to the Groupe Scolaire where I had studied—I didn’t see anyone. I couldn’t believe it. Not knowing anyone in the country where you grew up. It's quite strange.",Interviewee,No Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,Going back to the idea of physical reconstruction—I don’t know if there was also a psychological reconstruction?,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Some efforts are made towards a psychological reconstruction too. I think that something ... as a psychologist ... and I talk about it during my conference presentations—when I meet colleagues, psychiatrists, I tell them that there are things we don’t know on the level of psychological reconstruction of individuals. Why? Because the genocide of the Tutsis is a trauma for every Rwandan Hutu, Tutsi, Twa, the expatriates who were there, anyone who was in Rwanda at the time, it’s a trauma in the sense that we define trauma. It’s a trauma that can lead to what is called “post-traumatic stress disorder”: witnessing extraordinary atrocities. So seeing someone being killed, stepping over dead bodies in the streets, roadblocks, and so on—whatever your ethnicity, this is a traumatic situation. One million people died in three months. And we’re not talking about the wounded, we’re not talking about the people who were raped, we’re not talking about the other millions of people who were deeply traumatized. So travelling around this country and seeing people who don’t ... yes, there are people who have had serious psychological traumas, dissociative states, psychotic states, depression, or syndromes of post-traumatic stress, but we would expect this to be the case for almost all Rwandans. I would have expected that at least five million Rwandans fell into depression and almost seven million fell into major depression and experienced post-traumatic stress. And what do we see? People are still standing. Yes, some might say: “It was very hard for so and so, he doesn’t seem to be able to pull through, it’s very difficult,” but the majority of people are standing on their two feet. No doubt, on the inside, many of them feel distressed, but they are standing on their two feet. They are standing without being helped by psychologists. Last year I was again in Rwanda—there are now many psychiatrists there. Last year there were three. Now, after the genocide, there are about a 100-150 psychologists in the whole country. The three psychiatrists are in Kigali; two of them work full-time, the third works part-time. And most of the psychologists are in Kigali and work for NGOs. It must be said that most of the people who have experienced these deeply traumatic events have not received counselling help in the sense that we understand that here. In any case, they haven’t received help from specialists. And they have still managed to pull through—how can we explain that? That, to me, as a Rwandan psychologist, remains an unknown.",Interviewee,Tension
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,This phenomenon should generate a lot more research rather than treatment.,Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"Absolutely. I'm shocked when I see people ... when they talk about the genocide and what is of interest to them is depression and post-traumatic stress. And I say to them: “What should be of interest to us is, rather, the question of how people who have been through such horrendous events can continue to function.” Including the Rwandan Tutsi survivors who are here in Montreal. I’ve talked to many of them about this. I said, “Have you gone to see a psychiatrist? Have you done a psychotherapy treatment?” Many have not; they haven’t seen psychiatrists, they haven’t seen psychologists and they are able to fulfill their family and professional and social responsibilities. It’s surprising that someone who has experienced such terrible things ... and we’re talking about not only witnessing them, we’re talking about people who have lost their entire families, relatives and who have been traumatized, who have lived in appalling conditions for months and months. As a psychologist, I—really, no psychiatrist nor psychologist could write about it because when the Holocaust happened [inaudible] and they started working on the Holocaust [inaudible] years after that. There was the Cambodian genocide, which has been completely suppressed; the trials of the former Cambodians are just beginning. There hasn’t been much research on this. In fact, it’s the Rwandan genocide, really, that has generated scholarly interest, but we still have a lot to learn from the Rwandans. To understand what happened and where they get this strength from. That people have experienced post-traumatic stress, in the sense that we understand it—for some, that’s indeed the case. But it’s surprising to see how many people have pulled through. And … well, there are many terms we use: resilience, post-traumatic awareness. I think that at one point we have to put the theories aside, work closely with the Rwandans and ask them to talk to us, so that they can enrich our theories. Because the danger is starting work, starting research with a questionnaire that we have developed, a questionnaire on post-traumatic stress, developed on the basis of the experiences of people who have been in car accidents, American soldiers who have fought in the Vietnam war or who have come back from Iraq and who have seen psychiatrists, psychologists and who have flashbacks, and so on, and we have created a questionnaire based on that and we want to apply the same questionnaire to Rwandans. Or a bus driver who’s been in an accident or a taxi driver who’s been in an accident and who have seen blood and other things, and who have experienced trauma, etc....—but we can’t compare that to the genocide. The Rwandans have lived through something different. That's what I’m interested in, that's what I'm trying to understand and I would humbly say that I still can’t understand it.",Interviewee,Tension

ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"I feel … I still feel sadness, loneliness when I think that this abominable crime, this genocide committed by hundreds of thousands of Rwandans—that there isn’t a movement on the part of the Hutus to ask forgiveness. That there aren’t any Hutus able to do a symbolic gesture of reparation like that. I don’t think it’s enough just to ask forgiveness with speeches, with petitions—there must also be reparations. But to me the reparation will be symbolic. The survivors who have lost their parents, the men who have lost their wives, the women who have lost their husbands, the people who have lost their brothers and sisters—nothing can restore those losses. The reparation will always be symbolic. But there must be reparation. We shouldn’t only ask forgiveness. Everyone can make amends according to their means. So the question you're asking me—it really is a feeling of loneliness because when I visit Rwanda, I see there signs of physical rebuilding. The people are doing everything they can to live together, Hutus and Tutsis. But people continue to act as if nothing has happened. As if …, once again, this denial that I saw when I was in high school when we knew that there were Tutsi students, that their houses had been burned, their parents had been killed or injured, or some had their parents leave as refugees abroad and they remained in Rwanda to be brought up by an uncle or an aunt, but we knew that their parents were abroad—we said absolutely nothing about that and my impression is that the same thing is happening in Rwanda now. The price we are asking from Rwandans, from the Rwandan Tutsis, those who were in Rwanda, the price we are asking them to pay—the reconciliation, the reconstruction—it’s enormous. In my opinion, it rests on the shoulders of Tutsi survivors. It's like asking them to close their eyes, to forget. And to remember during moments of commemoration only. I, as Hutu—yes, I now accept this identity that I didn’t accept until I was 50 years old. I didn’t care being Hutu, but from the age of 50 I was forced to recognize that, yes, my ancestors were Hutu. I have to live with this Hutu identity. And to me, this Hutu identity is really shameful. I'm not personally ashamed, but I feel shame for the Hutus and that makes me feel so ... not pain, but ... I don’t know how to name it. I think that even if it's humiliating ... for sure this humiliation ... than asking forgiveness. But what is that humiliation compared to the people who have lost everything? What difference does it make recognizing that my people have committed a crime and that I’m asking forgiveness on their behalf? In this act of humility, I’m asking forgiveness on behalf of those who don’t want to ask forgiveness. To show humility, to kneel, to beg for forgiveness from a survivor. This gesture of showing humility is considered a form of humiliation by many Hutus who don’t want to ask forgiveness. But they must always consider that this humiliation is nothing compared to someone who has lost everything, who is like a tree in a bushfire, a tree that stands alone, everything has burned around it and it starts to grow a few branches—some of the survivors remind me of such a burnt tree—a bushfire that completely destroys everything and this one tree whose branches are burned and, little by little, starts growing a small leaf and then a branch, and it starts coming to life again, although the burns are still visible. And next to it, the Hutus are like the nearby forest—thriving, green, with its branches, its trees, rich with game, and they are there. The future of this country ... fortunately, there are young people, but it’s a pity that the Hutu adults who were in Rwanda and who are still there, continue to live by this kind of thinking: “We’ll get older and then we’ll be buried and forgotten, and as the years pass, all of what happened will be buried.” So they start new businesses and continue to act as if nothing has happened.

If we are to say “this must not happen again,” we can only prevent it from happening if we have the courage to face these horrific scenes and to talk about them to our children and to strangers. For me, a Hutu, to be able to tell that to other Hutus, to be able to tell it to strangers and to tell it to the Tutsis I meet, and who might say, “Should we listen to this Hutu? Is he sincere or is it simply indyarya, a hypocrisy?” I wouldn’t be hurt if people think that. I would understand completely and definitely wouldn’t be angry at a Tutsi who says, “We don’t trust this Hutu who pretends to distance himself from those of his fellow Hutus who are rejecting us and who don’t want to do the honorable thing and apologize.” It’s quite understandable that one can be wary of all Hutus because, at present, the Hutu people—when I was in Rwanda and everywhere I go—I ask the question “Is there currently a movement organized by Hutus with the intent to ask forgiveness? Would there be Hutus who...” I was giving a presentation last year, last December, I was invited to a forum organized by the first lady. After my presentation someone asked me a question—at some point after I finished my presentation—and the question was how do I feel being a Hutu. How do I see the future of the country? And I said that when I go back to Rwanda my hope is to find several Hutus—two, three, five individuals—with whom we can sit down together and see how we can start the work of repair, symbolically of course. As I was saying, the work of repair here can only be symbolic because we can’t bring back the dead. We can’t forget the horrors that took place, but at the same time what happened has happened—the tragedy that the Tutsis have experienced, the appalling act of genocide. But life goes on. We must rebuild the country. But to rebuild the country there must be people who are able to say: “We have done horrible things.” Even if one didn’t personally participate, to be able to say that there is a guiding ideology. And that ideology was collectively fueled by the people of our ethnic group with the intention to eliminate another ethnic group. We have to be able to denounce that because currently there are still deniers. I can tell you, I hesitated going to Rwanda after the genocide and I went because I was invited, mainly by my Tutsi friends. I didn’t want to go because I didn’t want to go places and be seen by a Hutu who comes up to me and hugs me and starts telling me about how miserable things are and how tragic things are for the Hutus in Rwanda today, and, unfortunately, that’s how I felt on two or three occasions during my trip to Rwanda. The people I knew ... especially two women I knew in the 1980s before I left—knowing that I am Hutu, they felt comfortable talking to me about their misery, because currently they say that the power belongs to the Tutsi and that the Hutus are left behind. And who else can a Hutu confidently say this if not to another Hutu? Witnessing the plight of these people, who at the same time say absolutely nothing about the genocide, who say absolutely nothing about their neighbours, but who only talk about how distressed they feel now, akababaro ka bahutu, at present. It's terrible and when I see it happening I ... I find it disheartening. That's why I say: I wish there were a few Hutus with the good will to get together and say: “What can we do to repair the harm done?” What are the best actions to do that? Create a small foundation for example, help the orphans, the many children in Rwanda who are heads of households. Help the widows. Engage the young people. Have the courage to speak to the deniers, who are numerous both in and outside of the country, to say to them: “We have committed a crime and we must be able to forget.” Not to judge the current government. Have you seen a current African regime that doesn’t commit excesses? All regimes, and not only those in Africa ...—we talk about corruption in Rwanda, but is there a country without corruption? In this beautiful country [Quebec, Canada], we talk about corruption in the construction sector. There’s corruption everywhere. But it’s as if the opponents of the current regime in Rwanda focus on what is wrong in the country as a pretext to avoid the subject of the genocide. And I say: “These are two different things.” We can’t pass judgement on Kagame’s regime and mix it up with the genocide. We can’t talk about how opposition in Rwanda is muzzled and use that as a way to avoid talking about the genocide. These are two completely different things.",Interviewee,Tension

But I would like to conclude this interview with something you said. You said that despite everything life goes on. So I think we can end on this hopeful note. I don’t know if you have any final words you’d like to say before we end?",Interviewer,-
ENTREVUE EMMANUEL HABIMANA-LS-English Translation.docx,"[Sighs, expression of deep reflection] I would especially like to say a big thank you to the Montreal Tutsi community. I think the Tutsi survivors in Montreal are very brave. They’ve worked very hard, they’ve gotten involved in this project and they welcomed me. They welcomed me as a Hutu who wishes to express his sincere sympathy with what they have gone through and who ... they have understood that, yes, it’s possible that Hutus also participate in the rebuilding of our country. It is possible and, if ever Hutus can see this testimony, I’d like to say to them: “Let us have the courage to rebuild our country. Our country’s wounds are many. And many people have been terribly scarred. Let us have the decency and the humility to ask forgiveness and help these people at the time of their grieving. This time of grieving is painful for the majority of survivors.” Yes, there are some Hutus who have experienced misfortunes during the genocide. Some Hutu families have been decimated. Some Hutus died during the genocide. But they didn’t die because there was a genocide [directed?] against the Hutus. They died because of this genocide, they died because of the war, they died no doubt because of the retaliation of the RPF army, they died because of the consequences of this genocide. I would like those Hutus who show good will to be able to put things in perspective and to be able to...—and I would like to conclude on this point—if the Rwandan community of Montreal, both Hutus and Tutsis, if they could at some point commemorate their dead together, because the Hutus have also lost members of their families. That they be able to commemorate with the Tutsis saying, “Yes, we have also lost loved ones during this genocide, but let us build our country together. Let us be true brothers and not only in the rhetoric of demagogic speeches, let us be brothers because we are destined to live together in this small country and abroad, to share this Rwandan identity because we said no to Hutuland, to Tutsiland, and we are all Rwandans. We must continue to live together and that’s important. Let us truly forgive each other so that we can work together.”",Interviewee,Tension
